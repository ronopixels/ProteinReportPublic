description: MicroHarvest is a biotechnology company that produces sustainable
  proteins through microbial fermentation, using agricultural byproducts as
  feedstock. Their proprietary technology allows them to produce protein
  ingredients much faster and using significantly less water and space compared
  to animal or plant-derived ingredients. The dried biomass is then combined
  with other ingredients to make food products, with applications ranging from
  feed to pet food and human food.
