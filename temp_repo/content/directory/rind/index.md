description: "RIND is a plant-based cheese of the future that goes through a primordial process; microbes break down the proteins & fats into many molecules that pack tons of flavors. Edible spores form a rind that locks in and magnifies this magical, biological process. Rind uses a proprietary blend of ancient microbes, fats, proteins & sugars to make flavors that other plant-based cheeses can only dream about."
