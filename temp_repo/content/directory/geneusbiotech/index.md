description: "In May 2020, GENEUSBIOTECH entered into an R&D project with various research institutions to further develop the technology of bioprinting. This will include the cultivation of biomaterials such as cell-based fur, as well as the cultivation of human hair for transplantation into the scalp. GENEUSBIOTECH has patented the method it has developed. Meanwhile, interest in the technology from the outside world is growing and GENEUSBIOTECH was also a guest at the World Congress on Alternatives to Animal Testing."
