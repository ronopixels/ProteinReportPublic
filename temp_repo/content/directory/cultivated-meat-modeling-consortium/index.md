description: "Cultivated meat promises to solve some of the world’s most urgent problems, including feeding ten-billion people by 2050, preserving ocean ecosystems, and reducing animal agriculture’s impact on the climate. Yet, to fulfill this promise requires that the cultivated meat field first develop efficient processes that create desirable products. We believe using computational modeling can accelerate the optimization of both processes and products, enabling the field to mature into an industry years before it otherwise would, while also reducing the cost of that transformation."
