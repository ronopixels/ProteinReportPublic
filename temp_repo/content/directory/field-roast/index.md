description: "The original maker of grain meats, Field Roast uses fresh whole food ingredients — grains, vegetables, legumes and spices — to craft our artisanal plant-based meats and cheeses. Since launch in 1997, the brand has been a pioneer in the plant-based industry by using traditional food-making practices to create flavor-forward foods that celebrate plants. Our ever-expanding portfolio of plant-based products includes roasts, sausages, deli slices, loaves, a frankfurter, and a burger, as well as our very own Chao Creamery cheese."
