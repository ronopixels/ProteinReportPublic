description: "Rilbite produces an alternative product that combines just eight purely plant-derived ingredients including rice, lentils, tomatoes, soy or pea, unsweetened cranberries and onions. This means it has a clean-label nutrition deck often two or three times shorter than competitor products. Rilbite contains just 146kcal (almost half that of the leading brands) with 22g of protein and 0.2g of fat per 100g of product. The brand has a taste, smell and texture that all resemble ground beef, meaning it can be easily substituted in for meat without changing too much else."
