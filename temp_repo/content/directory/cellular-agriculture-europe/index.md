description: "Cellular Agriculture Europe, an association under formation in Belgium, is a coalition of companies that are committed to playing their part in building a more resilient and sustainable future. We are entrepreneurs, innovators, and food lovers who developed an alternative to the current production process for animal products. By efficiently growing meat or fish directly from its building blocks, the cells, rather than the entire animal, we can help feed a growing population without harming the planet."
