description: "Pleese Foods is a plant based cheese company founded by Kobi & Abev Regev.  Not satisfied with the products available on the market, the couple created a delicious alternative to dairy cheese that would stand the scrutiny of the pickiest eaters of them all… New Yorkers and children. At first, Kobi & Abev wanted to launch with their own pizzeria, “KOBEV’s Plant Based Pizza,” but after doing research they realized that they would have a much more meaningful impact on the planet if they launched their products in grocery stores."
