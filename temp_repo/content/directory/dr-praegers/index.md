description: "Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods® was founded in 1994 with the mission to bring delicious frozen food to everyone. It is not every day that two heart surgeons get into the food business, but over 20 years ago that’s exactly what happened. Motivated by what they saw in their practice, they set out on a mission to encourage sensible eating. They knew ingredients had to be nutritious and simple, that everything had to be delicious, and that their products needed to be super simple to make. The company produces plant-based alternatives and some other convenience foods."
