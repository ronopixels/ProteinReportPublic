Consumer demand for plant-based products is growing rapidly, and a broad
portfolio of plant proteins is now available for plant-based meat, egg,
and dairy applications.

This webinar will explore the key characteristics of plant protein
sources for alternative protein end products, including:

-   A basic overview of plant proteins, processing, and choice
    parameters like functionality, price, sourcing, and nutrition.
-   A glance at the landscape of major (e.g. soy, wheat, pea) and
    emerging (e.g. lupin, mung bean, duckweed) plant protein sources.
-   Synergistic combinations of different plant proteins.
-   An overview of processing considerations for plant proteins across
    key applications.
-   Consumer perceptions of different plant protein sources.

**Panelists include:**

 

-   Emma Ignaszewski, Corporate Engagement Project Manager, Good Food
    Institute
-   Chris Gregson, Greenstalk Food Consulting
-   Kyle Gaan, Research Analyst, Good Food Institute
-   Erin Rees Clayton, Associate Director of Science and Technology,
    Good Food Institute
