COVID-19?**

food and beverage industry due to the pandemic. There are
transformational shifts happening that will last far beyond the
outbreak. Dr. Charlebois, a leading agrifood expert from Dalhousie
University, will talk about topics such as the democratization of the
supply chain, growth in online grocery shopping, a new emphasis on food
security and food processing, and an accelerated return to the trend in
plant-based proteins.
