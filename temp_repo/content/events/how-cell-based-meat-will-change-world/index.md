Jim Mellon has written Moo's Law to provide the reader with the
first-ever review of the entire alternative protein category, and the
associated supply chain of meat, poultry, seafood and allied industries,
and also goes a step further with his investment assessment of every
leading company in this space. He is joined on this webinar with two of
the leading authorities in the industry, Mark Post (Chief Scientific
Officer, Mosa Meat) and Lou Cooperhouse (President & CEO of BlueNalu)
for what promises to be an enlightening hour for both those familiar
with the cellular agriculture sector and those who are new to the New
Agrarian Revolution.
