[Cellular Agriculture Canada](http://www.cellag.ca/) is excited to
announce our next event: Cellular Agriculture and the Canadian
Regulatory Framework. Join us on March 4th and explore how a regulatory
framework could look like for cultured meat in Canada with regulators
from the Canadian government.

As cellular agriculture companies continue to move forward and closer to
market, it is crucial that a regulatory pathway is developed together
with regulators. After CAC published [our white
paper](https://www.cellag.ca/regulatory-white-paper) exploring a
regulatory framework for cultured meat in Canada with regular feedback
from Canadian regulators, join us for the *first* event bringing
together Canadian regulators to discuss the regulatory framework around
how cultured meat may be regulated in the country.

From individual presentations by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA), Health Canada, and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC),
the event will conclude with a panel discussion featuring regulators
addressing the questions set forth in our white paper. 

If you are interested in learning more about how cultured meat can be
regulated in Canada and how it can come to market, register now and we
look forward to welcoming you to the event.

**Agenda**:

-   Introduction and Canadian Cellular Agriculture Landscape by CAC

-   Food & Feed by Health Canada and CFIA

-   New Substances Program (NSP) by Health Canada and ECCC

-   Food Labelling by CFIA

-   Regulatory Panel Discussion by Canadian Regulatory Experts
