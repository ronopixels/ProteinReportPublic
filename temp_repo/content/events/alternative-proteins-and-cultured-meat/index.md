## Alternative Proteins and Cultured Meat

ZETA has many years of **process experience** and **in-depth product
know-how** for the biotech and food industry. The specialist for aseptic
production processes also keeps a close eye on **current trends. **Find
out in this **ZETA webinar** how your company can benefit from
our **scale-up know-how** for the fermentation processes
of **alternative proteins and cultured meat.**

**Forward-looking technologies for sustainable nutrition**\
Fermented proteins and cultured meat are on everyone's lips - but so far
only in a figurative sense. However, it is only a matter of time before
the meat from "Cellular Agricultrue" lands on our plates as
a **sustainable** and **animal-friendly alternative.**

**Breaking new ground together with ZETA**\
Before it is ready for the market, there are still a few hurdles to
overcome, especially with regard to **scalability,
costs** and **regulatory approvals.**

**The central question of the webinar is: How is an efficient scale up
from laboratory to industrial production possible?**\
The answer: With ZETA, a partner with industrial experience who can
support you in scaling up these processes in a variety of ways!
