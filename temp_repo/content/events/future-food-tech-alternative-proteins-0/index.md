**Cultivating Partnerships to Scale Novel Proteins**

Future Food-Tech's dedicated Alternative Proteins Summit on June 21-22
will connect global food leaders to map out the future of protein.

Returning for its second year, Future Food-Tech's dedicated Alternative
Proteins Summit takes place in New York to reunite the protein industry
to explore new approaches to scaling novel technologies.

On June 21-22 the summit will not only bring important conversations to
the fore in the form of debates, panels and presentations, but also give
attendees the opportunity to taste the future of food. From our iconic
Taste Lab, allowing audience members to network with likeminded business
leaders whilst trying new products, to our onstage cook-off session
Step-Up to the Plate, the event's marriage of interactive sessions,
content-led programing and targeted networking is unmatched.

Identified through extensive research with food brands, start-ups and
investors, key themes to be discussed at the meeting include:

-   Treating Alternative Proteins as a National Security Issue
-   From R&D to Commercial: Turning the Science Project into a Business
-   Improving Fermentation Capacity and Reducing Downstream Costs
-   Cultured Meat: The Importance of Partnerships in Achieving Scale
-   Unicorns, Market Corrections & Private Capital: Financing the Food
    of the Future
-   Interactive Debate: Will Advances in Novel Foods Make Plant-Based
    Irrelevant?
-   Harnessing the Biological Activity of Protein to Deliver Health
    Outcomes
-   Protein in 2050: What Does the Future of Protein Hold?
-   Regulatory Approval of Cultured Meat: Which Country Will be Next?
-   The Effect of Branding and Language on Consumer Adoption
-   Plant Sourcing: The Impact on Carbon, Nutrition and Biodiversity
-   Leveraging the Sensory Properties of Protein to Simulate Animal Meat
    and Dairy
-   Women Leaders Powering the Future of Food
-   Alternative Proteins Investment Trends and Deal Flow
