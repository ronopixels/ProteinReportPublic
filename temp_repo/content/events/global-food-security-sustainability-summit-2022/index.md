The 2nd Global Food Security & Sustainability Summit 2022 held on the 30
June to 1 July 2022, would be one of the most important events ever held
to address the critical issues of food security from the local level to
the global level, and from an interdisciplinary and systemic food
systems perspective. The event will also showcase the latest
technological innovations driving food production that will become a
game changer for the food sector. The summit will invite multi
stakeholders from governmental organisations, private sector businesses
and NGOs to address the current disruptions and possible solutions on
the world food supply chain. Discussions will also include issues
surrounding sustainability issues and how societies and businesses can
design more sustainable solutions in their entire food chain to minimize
impact to the environment and reduce food waste. The event will also
devote sufficient attention to the future of nutrition in these exciting
times.
