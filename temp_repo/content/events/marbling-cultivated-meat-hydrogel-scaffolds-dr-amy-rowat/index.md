description: "Fat gives meat the texture, flavor, and deliciousness that we love. In order to grow cultivated meat with desirable intramuscular fat, or ‘marbling,’ it is imperative to produce edible scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) preferences of both muscle and fat cells. Join us as Dr. Amy Rowat, Associate Professor at UCLA, discusses generating hydrogel scaffolds that support the growth of myotubes and adipocytes with the goal of producing marbled cultivated meat."

Fat gives meat the texture, flavor, and deliciousness that we love. In
order to grow cultivated meat with desirable intramuscular fat, or
'marbling,' it is imperative to produce edible scaffolds that mimic the
extracellular matrix (ECM) preferences of both muscle and fat cells.
Join us as Dr. Amy Rowat, Associate Professor at UCLA, discusses
generating hydrogel scaffolds that support the growth of myotubes and
adipocytes with the goal of producing marbled cultivated meat.

Meet the speaker: Amy Rowat is an Associate Professor of Integrative
Biology and Physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. She
is also a member of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Broad
Stem Cell Research Center, Bioengineering Department, Center for
Biological Physics, and Business of Science Center. Rowat holds degrees
in physics, Asian studies, French, mathematics, and chemistry. She was a
postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Physics at Harvard University.
In addition to her commitment to research, Rowat has also pioneered the
use of examples from food and cooking as vehicles for teaching
sophisticated physics concepts to a general audience. She is the founder
and director of Science & Food, an organization based at UCLA that
promotes knowledge of science through food and food through science.
