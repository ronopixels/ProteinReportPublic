The alternative protein industry is in the midst of rapid development.
When some of the world's leading food manufacturers and restaurants
start focusing on alternative proteins, it's clear that there is a major
shift afoot. 

As consumers show more enthusiasm and companies reach milestones like
building the first pilot production facilities for cell-based meat, how
will the new economic landscape have impacted the future of this
segment?

In this session, The Good Food Institute, Unilever, and Rebellyous Foods
will discuss current protein diversification efforts and how these are
driven by both consumer demand and the imperative to minimize business
risk.
