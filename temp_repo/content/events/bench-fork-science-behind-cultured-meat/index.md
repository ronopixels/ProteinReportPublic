The global demand for meat is expected to rise nearly 70% by 2050. How
can we feed this growing hunger for animal protein with less negative
impact on the environment, human health and animal welfare? Cultured
Meat -- grown in a bioreactor instead of a farm -- could be the answer.
But what does it take to bring it to the dinner tables of consumers?

To find out, join our first ever Innovators' Club online edition, "From
bench to fork: the science behind cultured meat", with our expert
keynote speakers: Liz Specht, Associate Director of Science & Technology
at The Good Food Institute, and Lavanya Anandan, Head of Innovation
Field Clean Meat, Silicon Valley Innovation Hub of Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany.

During the event, hosted by Annika Zille, Head of Marketing and Market
Intelligence at our Innovation Center, we will explore the state of the
cultivated meat industry and the biotechnology behind it, answering key
questions like:

-   Why should we eat meat grown in a bioreactor?
-   Which technology hurdles do scientists have to overcome before
    cultured meat becomes mainstream?
-   What role do companies like ours play in the game?
-   How can partnerships accelerate the way from bench to fork?
