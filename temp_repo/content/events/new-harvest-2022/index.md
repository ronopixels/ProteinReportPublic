New Harvest 2022 is a live, in-person event about the emerging field of
cellular agriculture---the growing of animal products like meat, milk,
and eggs from cells instead of animals.

For two days, researchers, companies, students, policymakers, investors,
artists, activists, journalists, skeptics, early adopters, and more will
convene in Brooklyn, New York to discuss the future of cultured meat and
other cell-cultured foods.

We will explore the latest scientific breakthroughs and commercial
developments, and think critically about the multiple futures of food
made possible by cell ag.
