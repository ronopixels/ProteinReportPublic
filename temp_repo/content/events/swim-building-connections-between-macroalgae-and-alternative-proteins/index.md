Sustainable seaweed cultivation has the potential to play a key role in
expanding our planet\'s protein supply to meet growing global demand.
Join GFI for a Seafood Webinar and Informal Mixer (SWIM) event on March
16 on the role of macroalgae in alternative meat and seafood. We will
start with a panel discussion between seasoned experts in seaweed
cultivation, processing, and alternative protein production about the
opportunities and barriers to building all three industry segments in
parallel. We will then move to an optional networking session to build
bridges and identify opportunities for collaboration.
