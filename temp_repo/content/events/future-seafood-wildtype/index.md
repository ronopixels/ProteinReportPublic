**Join Wildtype for a delicious session preparing sushi-grade salmon
that is fish-free and redefines the sustainability of seafood.**

**About this event**

Sushi-grade salmon without the fish. Seafood without touching the
precious resources of our ocean. Both of these are now possible with a
new method of food production called cellular agriculture, pioneered by
the food startup Wildtype.

Join the co-founders of Wildtype and Executive Chef Nick Green
(L\'Auberge Del Mar) for a special evening of sushi-making and open
dialogue about how cell-ag seafood is made, and the challenges and
opportunities ahead.

Moderated by Dr. Liz Specht, Director of Science & Technology at The
Good Food Institute.

Hosted by the MIT Food & Ag Club and Stanford Alt Protein Project.
