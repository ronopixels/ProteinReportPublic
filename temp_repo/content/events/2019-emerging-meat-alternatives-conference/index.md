Emerging Meat Alternatives Conference (EMAC), a new conference organized
by AIChE, is one of few scientific conferences focused on technical
aspects of creating plant-based and cultured meats. Emerging meat
alternatives are a prime example where biochemical and high-tech
chemical engineering problems need to be solved in a multidisciplinary
environment with biologists, chemical engineers and bioprocess
engineers. The conference will focus on the technologies (and
challenges) shared by plant-based and cultured meat alternatives to
achieve the goal of creating protein-rich food that can replace
conventional meat.
