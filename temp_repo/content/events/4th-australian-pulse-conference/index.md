Pulses are uniquely placed to dominate any discussion about protein in a world concerned about sustainability. This “Future Food” focus will be open to single day registrants to encourage broader participation beyond the traditional pulse scientific research community, in particular the domestic food manufacturing industry."

The first symposium day investigates "Future Food" and will be devoted
to developing linkages between agricultural researchers and end-product
users such as food manufacturers and international markets. Pulses are
uniquely placed to dominate any discussion about protein in a world
concerned about sustainability. This "Future Food" focus will be open to
single day registrants to encourage broader participation beyond the
traditional pulse scientific research community, in particular the
domestic food manufacturing industry. There will also be a dedicated
sponsorship offering for this day.

The second day will focus on research related to the agricultural side
of production.

The field day provides an opportunity to examine Australian field
research aimed at pulse production in the northern agricultural regions
of Australia.

Please join us on what will be an exciting journey into pulse research
and development - pushing improved profitability for growers in a
sustainable manner whilst providing healthy options for human
consumption - Pulses for people, profit, and the planet.
