Join CAC's Executive Director, **Yadira Tejeda Saldana** and
moderator, **Ahmed Khan **from CellAgri during this event that will
bring together four talented researchers from across Canada. 

Research is the foundation of any industry. Without it, the industry
can't thrive. During this event, we intend to engage in a fruitful
discussion about the opportunities, the challenges, and the next steps
to make Canada a leading country in cellular agriculture.

If you have any questions that you would like our panelists to address,
share them with us at **info@cellag.ca**.

[**Panelists**]{.underline}

**Cameron Semper** is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Calgary
and a member of the New Harvest Fellowship Program.  His research
applies protein biochemistry to advance the development of serum-free
growth medium tailored for fish cell culture.  He is passionate about
cellular agriculture and excited to see the field develop and expand
within Canada. 

**Dr. Lenore Newman** is the director of the Food and Agriculture
Institute at the University of the Fraser Valley where she holds a
Canada Research Chair in Food Security. Lenore is also a member of the
Royal Society of Canada\'s New College. Lenore researches agricultural
land use policy, bioengineering in the food system, and the role of food
and agriculture in the creation of place. Her first book, Speaking in
Cod Tongues, was published to wide acclaim in January 2017. Her second
book, Lost Feast, was published by ECW Press in 2019. She holds a PhD in
Environmental Studies from York University.

**Dr. P. Ravi Selvaganapathy** is a Professor of Mechanical and
Biomedical Engineering at McMaster University and the Canada Research
Chair in Biomicrofluidics. He is also the co-director of the School of
Biomedical Engineering. His research interests are in microfluidic
devices and artificial organs. He has more than 22 years of extensive
experience in micromanufacturing, microfluidics and materials
development which has resulted in \~110 journal publications, 60
conference publications, 35 invited talks and 8 patents. Some of the
notable outcomes of his research are the world's first artificial
placenta device capable of supporting neonates in respiratory distress,
the discovery of electrotaxis of C. elegans worms in microfluidic
environment, Canada's first tissue engineered meat and development of
reagent free water quality sensors. His research has won several best
paper awards and highlighted on journal covers. He won the Early
Researchers Award in 2010 and has been named as a Rising Star in Global
Health in 2012. 

**Dr. Greg Potter** obtained his PhD in Food Science and Technology from
Dalhousie University and has a diverse background in bioprocessing,
fermentation science, analytical chemistry and microbiology. As a
researcher, he is particularly motivated to use his skills and
specialized knowledge to accelerate projects which address humanity's
need for more sustainable food systems, bioprocesses and bioproducts. In
the field of cellular agriculture, Greg is associated with Clean
Research, which is targeting the development of cell-based lean fish,
and with the Cultivated Meat Modeling Consortium, which is spearheading
the application of computational modeling techniques in the cultivated
meat space. Most recently he started working with New School Foods, an
emerging Canadian company focused on the development of safe,
highly-nutritious plant-based seafood ingredients and products for the
consumer market.
