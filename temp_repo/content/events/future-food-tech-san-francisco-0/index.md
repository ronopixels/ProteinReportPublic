It's been three years since we last gathered the agri-food community
together in San Francisco, and we're set for an explosion of ideas and
opportunities when we reunite on March 24-25. The Future Food-Tech
Summit has become the annual meeting place for the global food-tech
ecosystem. Food brands, active investors, start-ups and technology
leaders come together to exchange insights, be inspired, and identify
future partners.
