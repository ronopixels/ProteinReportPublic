With global seafood demand projected to rise over the coming decades and
sustainable seafood production unable to keep pace, the opportunities
for plant-based and cultivated seafood development and commercialization
are endless. Join the Good Food Institute and Changing Tastes for a
webinar on alternative seafood.

GFI will discuss the need for new seafood production systems and how
plant-based and cultivated products can fill in the looming supply gaps.
We will then discuss the current market landscape of both plant-based
and cultivated seafood.

Changing Tastes will then explore the findings for their new,
unprecedented study into what consumers and key buyers think we will be
eating in the next 2-3 years. Their research explores what's driving
Americans to look away from the ocean to satisfy their appetites. With
plant-based and cultivated seafood in focus, Changing Tastes will also
look at what species and types of products will be most in-demand, where
consumers will be buying them, what will be considered the most
delicious choices in the near future, and how COVID19 has changed the
market.
