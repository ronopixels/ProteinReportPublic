We at Cultivate are excited to host an online spring panel in 2021.
Cultivate is a multi-voiced forum for discussing cellular agriculture
from UK perspectives. We are very pleased to have an excellent panel,
with opportunities for audience questions, about the evolving context of
cultured meat and cellular agriculture here. Our guest panellists are:

Dr Alexandra Sexton, University of Sheffield. Alex is a critical food
geographer who has been analysing developments in alternative proteins
and high-tech meat since 2013. She is also a founding member of
Cultivate.

Russ Tucker, Ivy Farm Technologies. Russ is Co-Founder and CTO at Ivy
Farm Technologies, one of the UK's most recently publicised cultured
meat companies. He is also known as 'The Hog Father'!

Professor Frank Vriesekoop, Harper Adams University. Frank is a
Professor of Food Biotechnology with a wide portfolio of interests. In
2018, and again in 2021, he worked on studies of consumer perceptions of
alternative proteins in the UK and other countries.
