AltProteins 23 is a must for anyone engaged or interested in the
plant-based meat, cultivated meat or precision fermentation
sectors---from primary production, investment and R&D, to manufacturing,
foodservice and retail.

After last year's sold out, heavily waitlisted inaugural event,
AltProteins has become Australia and New Zealand\'s premier alternative
proteins conference, bringing our region's vibrant ecosystem together
under one roof to explore the latest success stories, learnings, and
insights that you can't get anywhere else.

In a clear sign of investment and support for emerging proteins, the
Victorian Government returns as the lead sponsor. This year's event is
expanding to accommodate 500 delegates, more concurrent programming and
it will have a food menu that will not disappoint!
