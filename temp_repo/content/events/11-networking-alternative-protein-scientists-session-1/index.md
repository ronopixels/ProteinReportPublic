The event will start with brief remarks from GFI\'s Director of Science
and Technology, Liz Specht, Ph.D. The networking sessions will begin
following these remarks. The event will also feature topic-focused
session rooms that you can visit anytime you want a break from
networking.

This platform will intelligently match attendees for a series of 1-on-1
