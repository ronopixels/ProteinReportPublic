**2022 Theme: Building Agri-Food Capacity, Security & Resilience in
Asia**

As the anchor event of Singapore International Agri-Food Week (SIAW),
the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit will bring together over
900 global leaders to identify the strategic priorities as we build
greater capacity, security and resilience in Asia's agri-food system.

From alternative proteins, aquaculture and CEA to sustainable
smallholder production, the world's leading agribusinesses, growers, CPG
and ingredient brands, entrepreneurs, investors, retailers and
policymakers will reunite to tackle the critical issues of 2022 and the
decade ahead.

Taking place on October 26-28 at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, this
renowned leadership summit will deliver three days of high-level
discussion, networking and deal-making. Featuring Ministerial keynotes,
interactive panels, executive briefings and tours to Singapore's newest
agri-food facilities, the summit supports new partnerships and
collaborations through a full program of 1-1 meetings.

We'll also be serving a menu packed with new proteins and locally grown
fresh produce, and look forward to celebrating a week of agri-food
innovation at our nightly cocktail hour.

Virtual delegates will stream all the content live via our summit
platform and have the same opportunity to network before and after the
summit as in-person attendees.
