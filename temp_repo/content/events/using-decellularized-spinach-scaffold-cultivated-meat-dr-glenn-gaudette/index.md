description: "How can we develop edible scaffolds for cultivated meat production? Vegetables, such as spinach, have a network of vessels used to transport fluid throughout their tissues. Through decellularization, the plant cells can be removed while keeping these vessels intact. This provides a scaffold for growing bovine satellite cells that is edible and cost-effective. Join Dr. Glenn Gaudette, Professor & Inaugural Chair of Engineering at Boston College, as he discusses how decellularized spinach can be used to support cell growth in a bioreactor setting."

How can we develop edible scaffolds for cultivated meat production?
Vegetables, such as spinach, have a network of vessels used to transport
fluid throughout their tissues. Through decellularization, the plant
cells can be removed while keeping these vessels intact. This provides a
scaffold for growing bovine satellite cells that is edible and
cost-effective. Join Dr. Glenn Gaudette, Professor & Inaugural Chair of
Engineering at Boston College, as he discusses how decellularized
spinach can be used to support cell growth in a bioreactor setting.
