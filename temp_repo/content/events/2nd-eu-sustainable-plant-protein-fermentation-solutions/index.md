**Sustainability is a crucial component underpinning the plant-based
trend**

Consumers are increasingly asking for clean label credentials,
traceability of the product supply chain, nutrition & environmental
impact of the products they consume.

Plant-based protein has moved to the next level, and its not as simple
as just offering a product out in the market. Cleaning up the label,
strengthening sustainability, sharpening regional sourcing of materials,
delivering more diverse offerings on the shelf are some of the focus
areas of the plant based protein trend.

Come join us in Prague this 2-3rd October for our 2nd EU Sustainable
Plant Protein & Fermentation Solutions conference and network with over
150 participants joining this event from all over the globe. Held
together with our 6th EU Starch Value Chain, register for both event to
maximise your networking opportunities.

The conference will share a half-day session with **6th EU Starch Value
Chain** conference which will take place on 03-05 Oct 2023.
