**The Wall Street Journal Global Food Forum meets again on February 9,
2021.** We will gather leaders in agribusiness, food production,
consumer products, economics and government to focus on how the food
industry is facing disruption, and the challenges and opportunities that
lie ahead as companies, markets, consumers and the industry adapt. Plan
to join us for unscripted interviews with leaders of some of the the
world's most influential companies and organizations---we're pleased to
announce that ADM Chairman, President and CEO **Juan R. Luciano**, Tyson
Foods President and CEO **Dean Banks**, and EU Commissioner for
Agriculture **Janusz Wojciechowski** have already confirmed that they
will participate. Smaller group, interactive discussions on a choice of
timely topics. And a new spin on networking that will make it possible
for our dynamic Global Food Forum audience to connect, reconnect and
gain new perspective on critical issues.
