IntraFish Media will host its second Digital Event on May 12, exploring
the fast-emerging trend of \"alternative seafood,\" and what it means
for the seafood industry, investors, buyers and suppliers.

Alternative seafood \-- items made of plants or fish tissue grown in
labs \-- is gaining traction among consumers, and the trend is
reflective of significant changes in consumer eating patterns.

The seafood industry, initially wary of alternative-seafood products,
seem to be embracing the segment, with major groups like Bumble Bee and
Frosta partnering with suppliers, or launching lines of their own.

Our dynamic group of speakers will discuss and debate how seafood
companies, investors and buyers should view this emerging trend.

**Panelists include:**

-   Joost Matthijssen, Investment Director, Nutreco
-   Roger O\'Brien, President & CEO, Santa Monica Seafood
-   Lou Cooperhouse, President & CEO, BlueNalu, Inc.
-   Chad Sarno, Co-Founder & Senior VP Culinary, Gathered Foods /Good
    Catch Foods
