Join the race to work towards Scalability, Affordability, Efficiency of
cultivated protein production !

According to a recent study done by the University of Helsinki,
completely replacing traditional meat with cultured meat would result in
a massive 78-98% reduction in GHG emissions, a 99% reduction in land use
and 45% reduction in energy use.

Indeed, minimizing our reliance on animal products will help lower our
overall footprint. The UN\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) says this is critical if the world is to meet its long-term
climate goals and limit global warming to 1.5C. The increasing demand
for high-quality sources of protein from the Earth's several billion
people cannot sustainably keep up with the available supply.

Cultivated protein has significant potential to feel this gap and
disrupt the traditional meat/ seafood industry, but do we have the
infrastructure to scale up ?

What revolutionary technologies are available to  enable mass production
of cultivated protein ?

How close is the industry to working towards reduction of cost across
the lifecycle of production ?

As the sector advances toward commercialization, can cultivated protein
serve as a deployable food technology that can help feed a growing
population and enable a more stable, secure global food system ?

Many critical open questions remain.

Ongoing and future research must address key technical challenges in the
industry, and there must be continuous and significant investment
support to ensure that cultivated meat has the greatest chance of
success !

CMT brings you the 2nd Cultivated Protein & Fermentation Solutions
conference held in Singapore on the 19-20th of Sept with an interesting
and impressive panel of speakers to discuss critical issues and
challenging solutions for the industry !
