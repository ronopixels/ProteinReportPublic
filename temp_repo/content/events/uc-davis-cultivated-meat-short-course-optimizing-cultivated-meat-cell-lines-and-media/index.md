***Sponsored by the UC Davis Biotechnology Program & the UC Davis
Cultivated Meat Consortium***

Join the UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium faculty and research team
members for an overview of the latest research approaches used to
generate cell lines and optimize media for use in cultivated meat
fermentations, as well as a look at the potential role of edible
microcarriers.
