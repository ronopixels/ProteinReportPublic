The European Algae Biomass Association (EABA) aims to promote a strong
link between **science, technology and business** in the algae biomass
sector.

Due to their high CO2 absorption, being grown in water and providing for
a beneficial nutritional profile, algae-based alternative fish and meat
applications are very important. In our technical webinar we will bring
together the main stakeholders for knowledge exchange and to foster
collaboration.
