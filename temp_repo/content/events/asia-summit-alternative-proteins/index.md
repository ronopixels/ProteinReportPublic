It is estimated that 31% of the growth of global protein consumption
between 2018 and 2025 will come from China and 13% from the rest of the
Asia-Pacific region, while only 2% is attributed to North America. This
is why Asia Pacific is such an important piece of the protein puzzle.

The Good Food Institute Asia-Pacific will share the real stories behind
this booming industry in our inaugural Asia Summit on Alternative
Proteins. This summit will not be like anything else you've seen over
the past couple of months. We will go in-depth, ask those questions no
one dares to ask, and create those real-life connections we've all been
longing for. Join us on 20-21 August 2020. This is the Asia industry
summit you don't want to miss out on.
