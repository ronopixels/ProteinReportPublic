The 2nd Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Protein Summit Europe returns
this summer with unmissable content on the technical implications for
the production of novel foods: 

-   Strain development and synthetic biology technologies
-   Scale-up planning and execution case studies
-   Ideal fermentation design panel discussions: liquid vs solid-state
    approaches
-   Downstream purification techniques: yield maximisation and
    by-product minimisation

In addition to these in-depth example-based sessions, our focus day is
set to explore personal *commercial and regulatory* journeys, from
companies such as **Better Dairy**, **Unilever, **and** ENOUGH**. 

This event is the ultimate platform for precision and biomass
fermentation companies and end-to-end product users to explore the novel
foods industry from every angle of product development.
