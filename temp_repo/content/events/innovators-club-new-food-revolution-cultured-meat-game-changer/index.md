**Is the world ready for cultured meat as a new source of food?**

The evidence suggests that it is, and 66% of our surveyed scientists
would be open to try it. Learn more about the impact of cultured meat on
society, the food industry and the future of meat consumption at our
upcoming online Innovators´ Club on **February 23, 2022**!

We are seeing a rapid increase in global meat consumption, just as the
scarcity of resources and climate change are becoming more urgent
challenges. Cultured meat promises a future in which the increasing
desire to eat meat can be reconciled with the need to protect the
environment, the climate and animal welfare. Get insights on our
recently published [cultured meat trend
study](https://www.merckgroup.com/content/dam/web/corporate/non-images/research/innovation-center/en/Trendstudy_EN.pdf) and
reflect on the aspects of our food industry that can be reshaped as well
as hurdles in technology, culture, society and regulations that cultured
meat need to overcome.

The event, hosted by **Annika Zille**, Head of Marketing at the Group
Science and Technology Office of Merck, will include the keynote **"Why
Cultured Meat?"** by **Timothy Olsen**, Head of Cultured Meat at Merck.
After his presentation, he will be joined for a panel discussion
by **Paul Shapiro**, author of a national bestseller and CEO of "The
Better Meat Co", **Aryé Elfenbein**, Co-Founder of Wildtype
and **Heather Ahlborn**, from the Life Science business of Merck.

Join us and get answers to questions such as:

-   Are the glory days of meat over and how ethical is its consumption?
-   How is consumer acceptance evolving?
-   How much naturalness does the modern diet need?
-   How close are we from eating cultured meat?
