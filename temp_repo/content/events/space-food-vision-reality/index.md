If we're going to create new food systems, they have to improve on what
we have and address the challenges we'll likely face. Trends point to
rising challenges and emerging opportunities - what's a pipe dream vs
what's attainable?

At Space for Food, we\'ll dive into alternative proteins, circular
food/bio economies, controlled environment ag, microbial ag and systems,
and the enabling tech and systems to make it all possible.
