In India and in other parts of the developing world, the story of the
smart protein sector is still being written. And as we grapple with the
effects of Covid-19, it's clear that we can't afford to settle for
anything less than a paradigm shift. At the Smart Protein Summit, we're
going to articulate our vision for the protein supply of the next
decade - one which stewards planetary health, tackles malnutrition,
benefits farmers and creates jobs for millions. We're calling this
vision the Mission for Smart Protein, and we invite YOU to design the
future with us.

You'll hear from industry-leading corporations, trailblazing startups,
influential think tanks, major policy and government groups, and other
iconic leaders in the smart protein sector about each of these pillars
of the new food system.
