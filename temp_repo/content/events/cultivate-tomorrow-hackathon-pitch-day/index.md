**Get immersed in the Cultivated Food, Cell Ag, Precision Fermentation
Industry!**

**About this event**

\*\*This event is for those interested in viewing the final hackathon
presentations, as well as those already registered to participate in the
hackathon. Registering here does not enroll participants in the
hackathon challenge.\*\*\*

Location: Virtual, Hopin Platform

Cultivate Tomorrow is the first US hackathon focused solely on cellular
agriculture and cell cultured food. This hackathon will work to lower
the barrier to enter the cell cultured food industry for STEM and
non-STEM individuals. We will create a large network and community of
diverse individuals with different backgrounds, skills, and interests.
Together we will brainstorm, innovate, and re-imagine the future of
food.

This event is open to all undergraduate and graduate students across the
US who are interested in becoming more immersed in this field, as well
as anyone related to the food and agriculture technology industry or
biotech and food tech research. We believe that only through
cross-collaboration will this industry succeed in redefining the food
system and allocation of our planet\'s natural resources.

Our teams will be working on one of our three hackathon tracks and
submit their final proposals by February 1st. This event will conclude
the hackathon with keynote speakers, panel discussions, student
presentation booths, networking events, and final awards!

We will have three unique panel discussions and presentations with
experts and innovators in these fields:

1.  Panel: What to know about starting your own cultivated food company?
2.  Panel: The Ethics of Cultivated Food
3.  Lightning Presentations: Even Newer Food Tech!
