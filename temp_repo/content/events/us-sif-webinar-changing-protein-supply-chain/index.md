The COVID-19 crisis has illuminated major issues in the global protein
supply chain, such as an overreliance on animals for dietary protein,
food system disruptions and poor worker health and safety. However, the
new year and the change of administrations in the United States provides
an opportunity for policymakers and investors to consider solutions to
these challenges.

Our Executive Director, Maria Lettini, will join the panel hosted by [US
SIF](https://www.ussif.org/) to discuss the shift to sustainable
production while addressing worker safety and environmental challenges.
It will also look at how investments and shareholder engagements can
help in shaping the future of protein.
