With cultivated meats quickly moving from the realm of science fiction
to a commercially viable reality, it is now more important than ever to
come together as a community.

The** 3rd Industrializing Cell-Based Meats & Seafood Digital
Summit** will bring together key decision-makers from biotech and food
tech, leading food & meat companies, and investors to explore key
challenges and opportunities in the successful commercialization of
cell-based meat and seafood for human consumption.

Meet 80+ of your peers with the likes of **Aleph Farms**, **Shiok
Meats**, **The Better Meat Co.**, **The Good Food
Institute **and **Memphis Meats Inc.** to discuss the novel
technological advances powering the new wave of cultivated meat
products, leveraging biotechnology to increase the scalability,
sustainability, affordability and production efficiency of
next-generation cell-based meat & seafood products.

As achieving desirable taste and texture that mimic conventional animal
proteins still remains top of mind for the sector, this year's program
will focus on important **operational and technical considerations to
successfully achieve scale, beyond your prototype or pilot plant,
without compromising on the quality of your products**.
