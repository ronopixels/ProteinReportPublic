With one-third of consumers choosing to actively reduce their meat and
dairy consumption and seeking protein substitutes driven by health and
environmental concerns, there is mounting pressure on food & beverage
brands to *reformulate* their protein alternatives. Next-generation
fermentation technologies are gaining momentum in the food industry.

The REFORMULATE: Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Protein Innovation
Digital Summit will showcase novel technological advances powering the
new wave of alternative protein products. Whether you have a
fermentation-enabled protein product offering or are looking to launch
into the growing alternative protein space, this digital event will
equip you with the latest view of the state of play in this emerging
field, whilst providing you with the chance to connect and collaborate
with those trailblazing this new area of food production.
