IAR -- The French Bioeconomy Cluster and EURODIA Industrie invite you to
join their workshop to learn about the tools at hand to recover plant
proteins as valuable products.

Relying on its long experience in purification and fractionation
processes for the dairy industry, Eurodia Industrie invites you to learn
about the most efficient combinations of readily available techniques to
extract the full value of plant proteins.

16:00 to 17:30 (CET Time)
