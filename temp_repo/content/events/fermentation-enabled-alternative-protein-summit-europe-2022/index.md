Our previous Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Proteins US Summit has
been well received by industry leaders, which has allowed us to evolve
our Fermentation Summit to be held in Europe this 2022. With a different
regulatory environment and developments taking place in the EU, this
year we'll also be focusing on the key challenges to Novel Foods and
gaining investment in Europe\'s landscape.
