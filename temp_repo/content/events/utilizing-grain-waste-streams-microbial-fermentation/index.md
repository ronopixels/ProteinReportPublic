Can fermented spent grains be a successful replacement for yeast culture
medium? In order to make microbial protein an alternative food source
that is both cost-effective and sustainable, we can use fermented
side-streams from Singapore's food processing industry to replace
commercial culture medium. Join William Chen, the Michael Fam Chair
Professor in Food Science & Technology at Nanyang Technology University
Singapore, as he demonstrates the use of solution from fermented spent
grains ---an effort initially launched to reduce food waste in
Singapore---as a novel culture medium to make microbial proteins part of
our future food system.

Dr. William Chen is the Michael Fam Chair Professor and Director of
NTU's Food Science & Technology Programme (NTU FST). In addition to
developing talent in partnership with Wageningen University & Research
(WUR), NTU FST focuses on developing food tech innovations aimed at
reducing food waste and powering a circular economy in Singapore.
William's experience in food technology and his views on food security
have been featured in the mainstream local and international media. In
2019, CNN's 'Going Green' program described Professor Chen as a
game-changing leader in the green food system.
