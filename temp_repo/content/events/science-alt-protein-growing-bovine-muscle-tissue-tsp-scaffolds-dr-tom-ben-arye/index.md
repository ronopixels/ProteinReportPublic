description: "Can textured soy protein be a successful platform for growing skeletal muscle tissue? In order to grow whole muscle cuts of cultivated meat, we need a three-dimensional scaffold to provide support to the cells and mimic the structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that is edible, delicious, and nutritious. Join Dr. Tom Ben-Arye, Senior Scientist at GFI Israel, as he demonstrates the use of textured soy protein—an edible, porous biomaterial that is commonly used to generate plant-based meat analogues—as a novel scaffold to support cell attachment and proliferation."

Can textured soy protein be a successful platform for growing skeletal
muscle tissue? In order to grow whole muscle cuts of cultivated meat, we
need a three-dimensional scaffold to provide support to the cells and
mimic the structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that is edible,
delicious, and nutritious. Join Dr. Tom Ben-Arye, Senior Scientist at
GFI Israel, as he demonstrates the use of textured soy protein---an
edible, porous biomaterial that is commonly used to generate plant-based
meat analogues---as a novel scaffold to support cell attachment and
proliferation.

Dr. Tom Ben-Arye is a Senior Scientist at The Good Food Institute
Israel. He joined academia 11 years ago specifically to accelerate
cultivated meat research and, during this time, he volunteered with
multiple organizations to advance the alternative protein field in
Israel. During his Ph.D. at the Technion, Tom developed a cultivated
meat technology, which was recently published in Nature Food. His
research formed the foundation of Israel\'s first cultivated meat
start-up: Aleph Farms.
