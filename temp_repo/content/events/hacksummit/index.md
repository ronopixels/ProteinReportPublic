The HackSummit brings together the brightest minds in Food and
ClimateTech on May 11-12.

Across the two days, the world's founders and funders will meet in
Lausanne for the ClimateTech event Europe deserves.

We\'ll cover hot topics from alternative climate financing to overcoming
scale up bottlenecks, molecular farming to new biomaterials, and
everything in-between.  

More than anything - it\'s a time to meet fellow founders, funders and
industry insiders in what we think will *probably* be the most fun
ClimateTech event of the year.
