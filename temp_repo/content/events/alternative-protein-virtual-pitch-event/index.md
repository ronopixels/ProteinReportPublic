NPC is very pleased to announce a special virtual pitch event dedicated
to the growing world of alternative protein. This investor-focused
initiative is a collaboration with **The Protein Highway** and **Protein
Industries Canada**, two key partners helping to build the alternative
protein sector.

The online event will feature companies involved in a broad range of
products and technologies in alternative protein, including plant-based,
cultured, and insect-proteins. The entrepreneurs will deliver a short
pitch on their business strategy and opportunity for investment, and
answer questions from the audience.

With the growing global demand for sustainable protein, this event is a
timely opportunity to get to know some of the up and coming leaders in
the field.

**Join us at 1pm EST, July 16th.**
