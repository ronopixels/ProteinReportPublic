The Virtual Summit on AgTech is hosted by the Tuck Center for Private
Equity and Venture Capital in collaboration with the Tuck Food &
Agriculture Club. This online conference focuses on current trends and
issues in agriculture and technology.

The Tuck AgTech Summit aims to bring together some of the most important
people and organizations pushing this space forward in order to
accelerate the spread of knowledge, create new connections, and generate
ideas. Now in its third year, the virtual conference will cover a wide
range of cutting-edge topics with an impressive lineup of speakers from
around the globe. This year, the conference will also host its first
ever Pitch Competition.

In contrast to other conferences and convenings, the Tuck AgTech Summit
is designed to be accessible from anywhere in the world with a simple,
low-cost registration.  Using the
innovative [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/) platform, attendees
join an interactive online environment.  Registration requires a small
donation (\$5 minimum).  All conference proceeds will be donated to
non-profit partners, to be announced for 2021.
