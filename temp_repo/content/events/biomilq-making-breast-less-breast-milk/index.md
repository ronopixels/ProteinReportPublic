description: "More than 4 out of 5 moms have to stop breastfeeding before the recommended six months. That means the vast majority of them are turning to dairy-based formula. And that means many of them face serious trade-offs, as infant formula lacks the critical nutrients of breastmilk and carries a heavy environmental burden. By culturing mammary cells outside the body and leveraging their natural ability to produce all 2500+ components of breastmilk, BIOMILQ believes that it can fully replicate the nutritional profile of breastmilk."

More than 4 out of 5 moms have to stop breastfeeding before the
recommended six months. That means the vast majority of them are turning
to dairy-based formula. And that means many of them face serious
trade-offs, as infant formula lacks the critical nutrients of breastmilk
and carries a heavy environmental burden. By culturing mammary cells
outside the body and leveraging their natural ability to produce all
2500+ components of breastmilk, BIOMILQ believes that it can fully
replicate the nutritional profile of breastmilk. Biomilq has just earned
the backing of the world's top investors, raising \$3.5 million in
Series A funding from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Bill Gates'
investment firm focused on climate change. Breakthrough Ventures'
investing coalition includes Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard
Branson, Masayoshi Son, Jack Ma, Michael Bloomberg, and Marc Benioff.

Hear from Michelle Egger, CEO & Co-Founder of BIOMILQ about how even
infants can help put the planet on a pandemic diet!
