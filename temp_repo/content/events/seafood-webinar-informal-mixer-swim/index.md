**SWIM is a chance to catch up on the latest science related to
cultivated seafood and to connect with your colleagues.**

**Thursday, October 29th at 7pm ET / 4pm PT**

Join the Good Food Institute for a highly informative presentation on
seafood cell line development followed by a networking session. Cell
line development is a key challenge in cultivated meat and particularly
cultivated seafood. We will hear from three research teams that are
currently working on some exciting new cell lines from popular seafood
species.

The webinar will be followed by a 1:1 networking session. If you\'re
working on alternative seafood and interested in joining, please reach
out to [**claireb@gfi.org**](mailto:claireb@gfi.org). Researchers
focused on plant-based and fermentation-derived seafood are encouraged
to attend as well, and we\'ll be using a platform that will match you
with other researchers based on mutual interest in specific technology
areas.
