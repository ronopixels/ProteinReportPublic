**About the conference**

Our current food production system is associated with a number of global
challenges: Foremost, food production is the single most important
driver of global greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for substantial
water and land use, environmental pollution and reduction in
biodiversity. Second, animal farming is associated with zoonotic
diseases, evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance and ethical
concerns regarding animal welfare. Third, many non-communicable diseases
and human deaths are a consequence of malnutrition -- including hunger,
overconsumption and consumption of highly processed foods. Fourth, many
valuable resources within the food production system are discarded as
about one third of the produced food ends as food waste or byproducts
that are not considered for human consumption.

These challenges are grand; however, tiny microorganisms might be part
of their solution. Microorganisms can be used to convert inedible
resources into edible food, to enhance taste and texture, to upcycle
food waste and to improve the nutritional value of food. In addition,
microbial biomass itself can serve as a nutritious source of food.
Finally, genetic engineering allows us to improve and expand the natural
abilities of microorganisms in this space and can allow us to produce
food ingredients in microbial cell factories through precision
fermentation.
