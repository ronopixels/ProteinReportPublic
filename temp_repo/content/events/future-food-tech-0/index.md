Creating Nutritious, Sustainable and Accessible Food for Urban
Populations

Focused on strengthening North America's food system in a post-Covid-19
world, Future Food-Tech New York returns as a virtual summit on December
2-3, 2020.  Trailblazing start-ups, leading food brands and global money
managers will explore the short and long-term impacts of the crisis, and
identify which areas of food-tech will have the most impact in 2021.

Across two days of interactive panel discussions, content-rich
presentations, 1-1 meetings and roundtable discussions, the summit will
unearth the most significant trends from the last 12 months, and
highlight breakthrough technologies that will be fundamental in
accelerating access to nutritious and sustainable foods in urban
populations.

*Food-tech's brightest minds will present live, before hosting breakout

All participants can schedule video 1-1 meetings with potential partners
