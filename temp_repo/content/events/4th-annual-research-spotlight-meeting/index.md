We are thrilled to announce PPIC's 4th Annual Research Spotlight Meeting
on March 29-30, 2023. This year, the meeting will be held over a day and
a half! The meeting will showcase research that is actively being
conducted in the plant proteins space, including the projects funded by
PPIC. The event features presentations from several researchers,
internal and external to the PPIC researcher cohort. New this year,
there will be two panel discussions from PPIC member industry
representatives who will discuss challenges and opportunities for plant
protein innovation. The first panel discussion on March 29th will focus
on plant protein based food products, while the panel discussion on
March 30th will be on plant protein ingredients. These panel discussions
will be preceded by a presentation on current consumer trends by The
Hartman Group. The event also includes an interactive poster session
with the opportunity to speak with students and researchers directly.
There will be a number of networking opportunities to connect with
potential collaborators, customers, partners, and fellow plant protein
aficionados.
