**Objectives**\
The ThinkTech! educational programme will enable you to develop skills
related to novel food processing technologies focusing on technical
aspects, as well as the related soft skills.

Thus, your critical thinking on the development of sustainable food
technology solutions will be enhanced, so that you are able to appraise
unintended consequences like product performance or sustainability
implications.

**Advantages**\
Our mission is to give you detailed theoretical and practical knowledge
about several technologies and skills:

Approaches for protein fractionation from plant and microbial sources
(EMF = electro-membrane filtration, PLE = Pressurized Liquid Extraction,
PCT = Pressure Change Technology)\
Extrusion technology for processing of alternative proteins\
Inspection of sustainability aspects of the production and advanced
technologies

**Career Opportunities**\
Get experiences in the knowledge of new technologies and the processing
of alternative proteins. This may help to step into new workplaces.

**Duration & Dates**\
This course will take place on December 8th and 9th of 2021.
