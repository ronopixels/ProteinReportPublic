Co-hosted by Evolve.ag and Big Idea Ventures, this event will offer
insights from four experts on how to propel cell ag into the future.

In this free, one-hour long roundtable, you\'ll hear from Singapore\'s
pioneers in the cellular agriculture sector:

Fengru Lin - TurtleTree Labs

Vin Srinivas - Gaia Foods

Dr. Sandhya Sriram - Shiok Meats

Dr. Matthew Zhao - Big Idea Ventures

We\'ll examine how Singapore became the first country in the world to
commercially approve cellular agriculture, also known as cultured meat
or lab-grown protein, for human consumption. We\'ll also discuss the
regulatory environment of cellular agriculture, food safety, and
consumer perception.
