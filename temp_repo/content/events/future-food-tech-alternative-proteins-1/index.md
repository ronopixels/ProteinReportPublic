**Future Food-Tech's Alternative Proteins Summit returns to New York in
2023, bringing together the world's leading players from the alt-protein
industry to delve into the challenges facing the sector and identify
strategies for success in today's market.**

Taking place on June 27-28 at the Marriott Marquis Times Square, the
summit will welcome 800+ leaders in cell-based proteins, precision
fermentation and next-generation plant-based ingredients to address
challenges and opportunities across the supply chain and accelerate high
profile, catalytic networking.

As the appetite for protein continues to skyrocket and alternatives come
under public scrutiny; investors, start-ups, ingredient providers,
biotech companies and global consumer brands will examine how to
overcome bottlenecks and build capacity to meet demand for nutritious,
sustainable, scalable solutions.

On-stage cooking, small-group product tastings, and a menu packed with
innovative meat, fish and dairy alternatives complement a full program
of in-depth panels, fireside chats and roundtable breakouts. Business
deals and long-term partnerships are built through 1:1 meetings and
those all important corridor connections
