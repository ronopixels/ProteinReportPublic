**ABOUT AIR PROTEIN**

At Air Protein, we're passionate about creating a new food system--one

warming the planet. Join our diverse team of passionate scientists,
engineers, and business leaders working to create the future of
food---meat made from elements of the air.

As an innovative food company, we are crafting the world's first
air-based meats to eliminate compromise between nutrition, taste and
climate impact. Using novel technology inspired by NASA, we convert
elements found in the air into protein. Air Protein's process is
carbon-negative by design, using less land and water, and is powered by
renewable energy. It's where cutting-edge science meets bold ambition to
reinvent the way we eat.
