## About Eden Bio

Eden Bio is a cutting-edge biotech startup at the heart of the synthetic
biology revolution happening right now in White City, west London.
Proteins are essential across industries, from foods and nutraceuticals
to industrial enzymes and therapeutics. Challenges producing these
products can make them commercially inaccessible and Eden Bio breaks
down this barrier. With our unique machine-learning platform to guide
genetic engineering, we increase the protein production capabilities of
microorganisms, enabling a range of new products and assisting the
transition to animal-free protein products.

With approaching Net Zero targets and worsening global warming, the
world needs to move away from animal products to reach a sustainable
future. Eden Bio's services revolutionise the microorganism fermentation
process in support of this goal, using synthetic biology to ferment
molecularly-identical animal products vats, just like how beer is
brewed.

## Job description

Eden Bio is looking for a driven and self-motivated individual who will
lead on grant applications and partnerships. These projects will fall
into two categories: 1) R&D projects to advance Eden Bio's technical

commercially-interesting synthetic biology products for a range of
industries and purposes. You will work closely with both the machine
learning and strain engineering teams, and report directly to Eden Bio's
COO.

    with wider workflow

## Essential Experience

-   Grant writing 
-   MSc or above in a STEM subject 
-   Communication of complex science
-   Networking with academics and research funders
-   Knowledge of yeast, fungal biology and protein expression
-   An interest in novel proteins and their applications across
    industries, including new biomaterials, food, cosmetics, industrial
    enzymes and therapeutics

## Essential Skills

-   Excellent verbal and written communication skills
-   Strong storytelling capabilities
-   Stakeholder management
