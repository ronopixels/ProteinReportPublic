About Clara Foods DBA as The EVERY Company\
Clara Foods DBA as The EVERY Company is a Bay Area venture
capital-backed company working towards a disruptive advance in food
technology by producing animal proteins without the animal using
fermentation. We join a new generation of entrepreneurs, activists and
scientists who recognize that the decades-old factory farm model cannot
sustain the dietary needs of 7 billion people and counting - and that
technology may hold a solution. As much as the growing market demands
for animal protein production exert pressure on food producers to
improve their efficiencies and outputs, there is also growing public
distaste for the environmental, animal welfare, and health compromises
of industrial-scale animal agriculture. 

Clara Foods DBA as The EVERY Company aims to subvert this moral and
economic deadlock by taking the animal out of the equation. We're
bringing products to the table that are produced completely animal-free,
use less land and water inputs, while matching the taste, nutritional
value, and unique culinary properties of animal proteins.

Clara Foods DBA as The EVERY Company is an Equal Opportunity Employer. 
All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment
without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, gender
(including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a
protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other
applicable legally protected characteristics.
