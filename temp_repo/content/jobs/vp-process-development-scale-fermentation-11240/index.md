**The Role:**

The ***VP of Process Development & Scale Up***** **will lead Air
Protein's Fermentation and Recovery Bioprocess to make novel ingredients
from bench to pilot to commercial production. Reporting to the CEO, this
person will lead and manage a team of engineers, chemists and
fermentation scientists that work within and across functions to support
the development and scale up of AIr Protein's fermentation products to
serve in a range of applications and markets.  

This includes integrating the process development function both upstream
(with product discovery, industrial biology and fermentation and DSP
functions) and process optimization from H2 bioconversion through
downstream processing  (with process engineering and design, scale-up,
technology transfer, manufacturing, and product applications functions),
overseeing the facility/plant builds, plant operations.  

This position will be located in the SF/Bay Area and requires candidates
to live in commutable distance to our facilities. Relocation assistance
will be considered.

**Key Responsibilities**

-   Lead design and implementation of the fermentation, process
    recovery, scale-up, engineering, R&D and operations.

-   Ensure safe and environmentally sustainable operations as
    uncompromised priorities by implementing process safety management
    (PSM) or Hazardous Process Design (HPD) initiatives and programs.

-   Lead (hire, develop, inspire, manage) a group of highly effective
    engineers, chemists, fermentation scientists  chemical engineers and
    research associates.

-   Continuously identify and implement leading-edge innovations in
    relevant areas of fermentation manufacturing and process chemistry

-   Initiate, plan, and monitor the development of fermentation, dsp and
    dsp processes as a functional manager and task leader.

-   Ensure a holistic approach to integrate both upstream and downstream
    considerations in product/process R&D

-   Contribute to and use first principle manufacturing economic models 
    to screen process concepts and evaluate outcomes

-   Oversee capital projects, facility, and plant builds

-   Optimize full process for ingredient production

-   Oversee further development & scaling of the technology

-   Oversee engineering and technology R&D of CO2/H2 bioprocessing,
    downstream processing, and bioreactor design

**Qualifications**

**Preferred **

-   Degree in chemical engineering, biochemical engineering, chemistry,
    or equivalent work experience.
-   15+ years of leadership experience in diverse bioprocess technology,
    R&D and engineering environments.
-   In-depth experience with fermentation bioprocesses and process
    recovery.
-   Experience leading and overseeing capital projects, facility, and
    pilot plant build.
-   Expertise with process safety management (PSM) or hazardous process
    design (HPD)
-   Experience in building and deploying innovation in a process
    development setting
-   Fermentation experience in the food, pharmaceutical, or biotech
    industries.
-   Experience with gas-to-liquid, gas-to-chemicals, hydrogenation, or
    hydrogen (H2) related gas processes.

Skills & Qualities

-   Strong leadership in safety, demonstrated
