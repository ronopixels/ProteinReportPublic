**ABOUT US**

At New School Foods, our mission is to accelerate the transition to a
kinder, healthier, alt-protein-first food system. Using plant-based
ingredients & our proprietary production technologies, we create
zero-compromise seafood alternatives designed for the average consumer.
Our healthy, whole-muscle, plant-based filets are made to look, cook,
taste and flake just like fish. All with a lower carbon footprint, and
without harming the ocean.

Through our focus on continuous R&D, we are building products that don't
just make change easier, they make it rewarding. They say "there are
plenty of fish in the sea" - come be a part of the New School team, and
let's make sure it stays that way.

**THE ROLE**

We are adding an experienced, innovative, and motivated Principal Food
Materials Scientist to lead our laboratory R&D activities. The Principal
Food Materials Scientist will have significant responsibility and
influence on the design of our food science R&D and product development
platform. Our ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of novel
food product design and development, with experience in product
formulation, sensory analysis, chemistry, structure, food safety,
flavor, color, analysis, processing, and preservation related to meat
and/or alternative meat products.

In this role, you will work closely with a team of food scientists at
our Toronto-based R&D lab & product development kitchen to develop and
modify the texture and flavor of our plant-based product. Demonstrated
capability should include the characterization and understanding of
protein structure/function relationships, particularly in novel food
systems.

**RESPONSIBILITIES**

-   Improve existing processes and formulations to enhance the
    organoleptic properties, texture, nutritional profiles, and cooking
    profile of our products, leveraging personal expertise, ideation
    with team members, literature and IP research, experimentation,
    materials procurement etc.
-   Drive new product development from ideation to bench-top prototypes
    to pilot production to consumer use, ensuring compliance with food
    safety standards
-   Design and execute experiments, write SOPs & protocols for new
    procedures, synthesize data and prepare results for review
-   Create and characterize hydrocolloid-starch-protein systems and
    develop an understanding of their macromolecular interactions
-   Lead collaborative interactions with a broad group of external
    partners including academic researchers, analytical service
    providers, consultants, ingredient suppliers,  equipment
    manufacturers, IP lawyers, and regulatory professionals.
-   Continuously search for and vet advanced technologies that
    complement areas of strategic focus, and gather insight into new
    ingredient technologies
-   Perform ingredient screening, carry out shelf-life experiments and
    develop well-defined test objectives for sensory experiments
-   Participate with scientists in the drafting of patents, scientific
    papers, presentations
-   Provide training and experimental guidance for a small team of
    scientists.
-   Maintain a laboratory notebook, upload data into online an knowledge
    management system and present research findings in a succint
    well-organized manner to the team
-   Maintain and operate a broad array of sample preparation and
    analytical equipment (texture analyzer, colorimeter etc)
-   Provide general laboratory support, purchase equipment and supplies,
    maintain a clean, organized, and safe work area, including routine
    maintenance & cleaning of equipment, utensils and work surfaces, and
    ensure compliance with all safety policies and practices.
