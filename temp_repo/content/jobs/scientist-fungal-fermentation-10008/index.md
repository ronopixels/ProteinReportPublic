The Better Meat Co. (BMC) is a sustainable food tech startup based in
Sacramento, California. Well-funded and partnered with major food
companies like Hormel Foods, we've built and are operating North
America's largest mycelium biomass fermentation facility, advancing our
patented technology to create the most sustainable food future for our
planet. 

Under the direction of the Senior Director of Research, the Fungal
Fermentation Scientist will be responsible for improving fermentation
processes at the bench scale, and in coordination with the plant scale.
As a Fermentation Scientist, you will play a lead role in tackling key
challenges in producing a novel food product. You will be a subject
matter expert in fungal physiology, growth, and metabolism, and drive
the development and optimization of traditional and non-traditional
fermentation technology and production workflows. 

**Key responsibilities**

-   Promote scientific and data-driven approaches to pose research
    questions, solve problems and troubleshoot processes.
-   Identify avenues for improvements of fungi and fermentation
    parameters to drive growth, protein production, and desired
    phenotypes.
-   Design and execute experiments firsthand focused on fungal
    morphology, physiology, growth optimization, and nutrient
    requirements.
-   Identify major inputs in fermentation processes that impact product
    yield and quality. Including substrate components and preparation,
    fermentation parameters, and downstream processes.
-   Prepare SOPs for fermentation and downstream processing.
-   Optimize fermentation pipelines by continually running analyses for
    KPIs utilizing expertise, analytical equipment, and external
    analyses.

**Qualifications and skills**

-   M.Sc. or Ph.D. in microbiology, genetics, chemical engineering, or a
    related field with 2+ years of experience in fungal fermentation
    process development.
-   Microbial fermentation experience with bioreactors. Experience
    working with filamentous fungi is highly preferred. 
-   Highly versed in statistical-guided experimental design and
    analysis. 
-   Skilled at employing software and statistical platforms for the
    analysis of large data sets (e.g. JMP, Tableau, Spotfire, or R and
    Python).
-   A proactive and innovative mindset coupled with an enthusiasm to
    tweak, improve and optimize processes.
-   Comfortable working in a start-up environment and handling dynamic
    priorities and timelines. A self-driven individual who desires the
    fast pace and extreme collaboration of a young company.
-   Must provide proof of identification and eligibility to work in the
    United States of America.

**Working Conditions/Hazards**

-   Work is primarily performed in a development lab setting. Work
    environment is fast-paced with unique challenges faced daily.
-   Work requires the use of fine motor skills, standing for extended
    periods of time, reaching and twisting motions and lifting 50
    pounds.

As part of the BMC team, you will have the opportunity to explore
innovative techniques, approaches and ideas combining the future of food
and sustainable agriculture. We can't wait to change the world with you!
