**ABOUT US**

At New School Foods, our mission is to accelerate the transition to a
kinder, healthier, alt-protein-first food system. Using plant-based
ingredients & our proprietary production technologies, we create
zero-compromise seafood alternatives designed for the average consumer.
Our healthy, whole-muscle, plant-based filets are made to look, cook,
taste and flake just like fish. All with a lower carbon footprint, and
without harming the ocean.

Through our focus on continuous R&D, we are building products that don't
just make change easier, they make it rewarding. They say "there are
plenty of fish in the sea" - come be a part of the New School team, and
let's make sure it stays that way.

**THE ROLE**

We are looking for a talented Food Scientist / Senior Food Scientist to
join our fast-growing team. This self-motivated, creative, and
results-oriented individual will have an understanding of the physical
and chemical properties of food ingredients, specifically,
hydrocolloids, starches, plant proteins, and their interactions. You
will leverage your extensive hands-on experience in food product
development to create new meat analog products with improved nutritional
quality, flavor, appearance, and texture. You must exhibit the ability
to think beyond standard methods, independently lead and reach
conclusions, and clearly deliver results. You'll have the opportunity to
make an immediate impact in our product formulations and initiate new
creative product concepts.

In this role, you will work closely with a team of food scientists at
our Toronto-based R&D lab & kitchen to develop and modify the texture of
our plant-based meat. Demonstrated research should include
characterizing and/or understanding the structure/function relationship
of proteins, particularly in novel food products and systems.

**RESPONSIBILITIES**

-   Actively support the innovation process: brainstorming and ideation
    sessions, concept development, concept screening, and
    commercialization in compliance with food safety standards
-   Improve existing methods and formulations to enhance their
    organoleptic properties, texture, nutritional profiles, and cooking
    profile, using personal expertise, materials procurement, literature
    and IP research, etc.
-   Design and execute experiments and prepare results for review; plan
    tasks with some guidance
-   Create and characterize hydrocolloids-starches-protein interactions
-   Participate with scientists in the drafting of patents, scientific
    papers, presentations
-   Perform high throughput screening and carry out shelf-life
    experiments
-   Maintain a laboratory notebook, upload data into online an knowledge
    management system and present research findings in a succint
    well-organized manner to the team
-   Apply statistical analysis tools to analyze and interpret the data,
    derive conclusions, and translate them into optimizing the product
    performance
-   Maintain and operate a broad array of sample preparation and
    analytical equipment (texture analyzer, colorimeter etc)
-   Provide general laboratory support, purchase equipment and supplies,
    maintain a clean, organized, and safe work area, including routine
    maintenance & cleaning of equipment, utensils and work surfaces, and
    ensure compliance with all safety policies and practices.

-   Demonstarted ability to work collaboratively within a high
    performance team
-   Adaptable to evolving scientific and business priorities
-   Willingness to grow in a dynamic environment and handle constantly
    evolving objectives.

**EXPERIENCE**

-   BS in a scientific discipline (materials science, physics or
    biophysics, chemistry, physical chemistry, biological or chemical
    engineering, or a related field) with 5+ years of product
    development experience in a food and/or food ingredient company
-   Experienced in food product design, including formulation,
    ingredient functionality and interaction, process design, product
    scale-up, plant testing and commercialization
-   Experience in food texture development and emulsion formulation
-   Experience in designing and executing experiments and analyzing
    results
-   Hands-on experience characterizing and quantifying food ingredients
    such as proteins, fats, hydrocolloids, flavorants, colorants, and
    nutrients using chemistry, rheology, texture analysis, and other
    scientific means
-   Demonstrated knowledge of lab techniques and instrumentation as
    evidenced by experience with several specialized instruments
-   Knowledgeable about the structural/functional properties of
    proteins, starches, hydrocolloids, and ideally how they function in
    food-related materials
