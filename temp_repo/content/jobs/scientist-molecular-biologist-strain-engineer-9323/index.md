Helaina is a team brought together by the belief that health and
developmental outcomes of all infants can be improved through
nutritional options closest to human milk. Our team is revolutionizing
the infant nutrition space by developing a food product meant to
uniquely support babies in their earliest stages. Helaina's R&D
ecosystem harnesses the power of naturally-occurring biological
processes in tandem with modern advances in the space of synthetic
biology, fermentation, and improved industrial processing. We are a
fast-paced startup looking for our next team member who is intensely
passionate about advancing synthetic biology for food and beverage
products. 

In this role, you will work in our NYC lab to strategize, plan, and
perform experiments on the Strain Engineering team. The successful
candidate will be a hands-on, motivated self-starter with a strong sense
of initiative and attention to detail. You will be responsible for
contributing directly to Helaina's company milestones by supporting
strain construction, strain characterization, and protocol development
Strain Engineering team. This is an excellent opportunity for someone
who is hungry to work in a startup environment and ready to do the best
work of your career. 

**Primary responsibilities include but are not limited to the
following: **

-   Perform experiments with demonstrated competence in standard cell
    and molecular biology techniques and aseptic technique 
-   Develop new techniques and molecular tools to support strain
    engineering and protein engineering 
-   Performing genome engineering using a CRISPR/Cas9-based system
-   Design of assembly strategies for building DNA constructs.This
    includes: primer design, performance of *in silico* assemblies,
    experimental planning and troubleshooting. 
-   Develop analytical assays to validate and improve recombinant
    protein expression from a microbial system 
-   Prepare technical reports, quantitative analyses, protocols, and
    scientific presentations 
-   Work in a highly collaborative, cross-functional team environment to
    perform experiments in the lab, analyze results, and communicate
    findings in team meetings. 

**Who You Are: **

-   Ph.D. with 0-2 years of experience or Masters degree with 3-5 years
    of experience in Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, or
    related disciplines. Start-up or industry experience in molecular
    biology or protein engineering preferred. 
-   Proficiency in standard methods of molecular biology, strain
    engineering, protein analytics, and optimizing protein expression. 
-   Extensive experience in genome engineering using CRISPR-Cas9
-   Experience with microbial expression systems for protein production 
-   Comfortable running PCR, restriction digests, different types of DNA
    assemblies, SDS-PAGE, ELISA, BCA, and Western Blot 
-   Energetic, creative, and personally motivated by the future of food
    and/or biological products 
-   Eager to troubleshoot through lab and experimental issues and
    discover new findings
-   Self-motivated to design, troubleshoot, and successfully execute
    protocols 
-   Effective communicator, both within a collaborative scientific team
    and in communicating science to non-technical audiences
