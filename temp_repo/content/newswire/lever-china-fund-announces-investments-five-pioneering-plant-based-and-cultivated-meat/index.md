**Shanghai** --- The Lever China Alternative Protein Fund announced
today it has completed its first five investments in pioneering early
stage alternative protein companies in China:

-   **HERO Protein**:  Lever China Fund participated in the pre-seed
    round for this Shanghai-based company, whose plant-based chicken,
    beef and fish products were formulated by former senior R&D
    executives at Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Gardein and
    Morningstar

-   **HaoFood**:  Lever China Fund led the pre-seed round for this

    nutritious ground chicken and chicken chunks

<!-- -->
```
-   **New Singularity**: Lever China Fund led the seed round for this
    Tianjin plant-based seafood company using novel manufacturing
    technology to produce plant-based shrimp, tuna, eel and other
    seafood products

```
-   **LIKE Foods**: Lever China Fund led the pre-seed round for this
    Beijing-based cultivated meat start-up using tissue engineering and
    3D bioprinting technologies to create sustainable and healthy animal
    protein

```
-   **Avant Meats: **Lever China Fund participated in the Seed round
    for China's first cultivated meat company, producing fish meat and
    whole marine proteins for the food, supplements and beauty sectors 

"In addition to looking for outstanding entrepreneurs, we prioritize
companies that bring innovative and delicious products and novel food
technologies to China. Our first five investments support pioneers in
China's alternative protein space, including the first dedicated
plant-based seafood company, a plant-based meat company pioneering high
moisture extrusion in China, and the country's first cell-cultivated
meat company. Our team's combined 15-year experience investing in
alternative protein provides Lever China Fund with the ability to help
our portfolio companies become category leaders in the sector," said
Nina Ju, Investment Director of the Lever China Fund.

The Lever China Alternative Protein Fund was launched in early 2020 by
Lever VC, a leading global alternative protein venture capital fund
whose partners were early investors in Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods,
and Lever Foods, a Shanghai-based consultancy that advises on the
alternative protein space. The Fund is operated in partnership with the
Brinc Accelerator, a Guangzhou, China-based alternative protein
incubator and accelerator run by Brinc, a leading global provider of
accelerator services. Corporate partners include food and beverage
leaders COFCO and Yili Group, national industry trade group the China
Plant-Based Foods Alliance, and top global alternative protein
ingredient and services companies Givaudan, Cremer and others.

Lever China Fund will invest 40 million RMB over the next four years in
entrepreneurs and early stage alternative protein companies focused on
the burgeoning mainland China market. Up to 160 million RMB is available
in potential follow-on funding from the Lever VC Fund, for a total
available investment pool of 200 million RMB.

"We are very excited to see the accelerating growth of alternative
protein in China, with industry giants like Starbucks, KFC, Cargill and
Nestle adding plant-based meat and dairy products in recent months,"
said Lily Chen, Program Manager of Lever Foods. "In addition to the
capital the Fund provides, Lever Foods leverages our broad network of
contacts in the food and investment sectors to provide our portfolio
companies with hands-on support in areas like R&D, fundraising, supply
chain, distribution channels and strategic guidance."

China is the world's largest consumer market for protein, both by volume
and value, and will account for 35% of the global protein market in
2025. China's plant-based dairy sector has reached 120 billion RMB in
annual sales and the plant-based meat sector has been growing 14% per
year.  The health and food safety benefits of these products, combined
with public interest and strong government support for the space, have
created a huge opportunity for innovative alternative protein startups.

**On Thursday, October 8 at 9 pm China Standard Time (1 pm GMT/ 9 am
EST), Lever China Fund will host an English-language Zoom webinar to
brief international investors on opportunities in China's alternative
protein sector, with short presentations from several alternative
protein startups. To register,
