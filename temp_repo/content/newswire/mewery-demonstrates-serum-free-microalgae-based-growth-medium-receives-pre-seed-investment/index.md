BRNO, October 19 --- Mewery, the Czech startup focused on novel
approaches to producing cell-cultured meat, has reached a new milestone
as their scientists have successfully developed a serum-free growth
medium that dramatically reduces the cost of cultivation. Along with
this success, Mewery reports investment from Credo Ventures and Purple
Ventures, closing their raise of almost a million dollars in their
pre-seed round. 

*\"The money will help us retrofit our new labs, expand our team with
additional scientists, and accelerate the introduction of our prototype.
Of course, we will also invest in further intellectual property
protection,*\" says Mewery founder Roman Lauš, who was one of the main
organizers of the Future Port festival, a future-positive tech festival
where the idea of setting up a company with significant social impact
was initially conceived.

*\"For us at Credo, Mewery is our first investment in a food-tech
startup,* *and we decided to go for it because Roman and his team
convinced us that their approach to meat culturing is extremely
innovative on a global scale and could contribute to a significant shift
in the way cultivated meat is brought to market. Roman and I have known
each other for many years,* *and the team he has put together is a top
in the industry,*\" comments Credo Ventures partner Ondřej Bartoš on the
investment.

Mewery\'s scientific team has successfully tested their target concept.
The goal of the startup is to develop pork products in the lab that are
cultivated from mammalian cells through a proprietary microalgae-based
growth medium. \"*We were able to validate our method in different
environments and obtain a proof of concept. By the end of the year, we
should have the first prototypes*,\" reveals Roman Lauš. 

**What makes the Mewery method groundbreaking? **

Fetal Bovine Serum, which contains growth factors and certain hormones,
in addition to base nutrients, is the standard used for many cell
culture applications. However, the use of FBS is both costly and reliant
upon the slaughter of animals.

\"*Our microalgae-based cultivation medium is FBS-free. This was the
main goal we set at the very beginning---a cultivation medium without
animal products. It means meat without animal death. In practice, we
have confirmed that it is possible to effectively use our proprietary
medium that allows mammalian cells to continue to grow just without the
use of FBS. In addition, we have saved 70% of the costs compared to
conventional cultivation methods*,\" explains Lauš. Thanks to this
approach, Mewery was selected among the top 15 startups in the food-tech
sector from more than 300 applicants to the Big Idea Ventures
accelerator almost a year ago.

**Why lab-grown meat? **

While there are already various meat substitutes on the market, because
they are mostly plant-based, the final texture and taste tend to be
significantly different from their animal-based versions. Mewery wants
to change that by bringing ground meat, meatballs, sausages, and, in the
future, steak to the market.

\"*We want to offer a healthy and sustainable alternative to
conventional meat, which means allowing meat-loving people to choose
meat that is slaughter-free, pathogen-free, and has the same taste and
texture they are used to*,\" explains the startup\'s founder, adding
that their initial final products will be similar to ground meat in
texture, but the composition will be different*---*in addition to muscle
and fat, microalgae will be added, creating a one-of-a-kind product.
\"*Microalgae gives the meat the so-called fortification label---food
enriched with other beneficial ingredients---such as vitamins,
antioxidants, minerals, fiber, and essential fatty acids, etc.,*\"
concludes Roman Lauš.

\"*Although it is a long-term view, we are convinced that alternative
proteins produced on the basis of animal cells will represent a major
shift towards a more sustainable, humane, and, we believe, healthier
future of food. And we see great potential in Mewery to be a major
contributor to this evolution,*\" adds Jan Stanek, founding partner of
Purple Ventures.
