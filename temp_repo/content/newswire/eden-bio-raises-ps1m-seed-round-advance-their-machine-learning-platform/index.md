**London, UK, 15 November 2022 --** Eden Bio, a UK-based biotech startup
using machine learning to increase protein yield, is delighted to
announce their seed investment round of £1M. This raise strengthens Eden
Bio's R&D capacity and ability to expand their underlying
machine-learning platform over the coming years. By using artificial
intelligence to genetically optimise microorganism strains, Eden Bio
improves the yield of protein products. Cutting the cost of protein
production is essential, and many companies across markets currently
struggle with low yield, whether they're producing industrial enzymes,
therapeutics, animal-free foods, custom proteins or media components.

The investment was led by **SynBioVen**, whose board includes Professors
Richard Kitney and Paul Freemont (two of the leading founders of
synthetic biology in the UK), Lord David Willetts (Chair of the UK Space
Agency, former Minister for Universities and Science, and creator of the
Synthetic Biology Leadership Council), and Sir David Harding (Founder
and CEO of research-based quantitative investment firm, the Winton
Group). Together, they are an elite team of synthetic biology investors,
and their links to the SynbiCITE incubator and Imperial College London
position Eden Bio at the centre of both world-leading technology and
talent.

Following in the round are: **Dhyan Capital**, whose founder Dr Amar
Shah co-founded the artificial intelligence unicorn, Wayve, and who now
uses his experience to support other machine-learning companies; **Saras
Capital**, which invests in early-stage companies focused on
machine-learning biotech and whose CEO Nadav Rosenberg has many years'
experience investing in and mentoring successful companies; and
sustainability investor **Stefano Bernardi**, who supports early stage
companies making a positive impact on the world. Additional investment
comes from a consortium of angels, including: Dr Noor Shaker (founder of
Glamorous AI), Dr Sandra Blewitt, Kevin Mascarenhas and Andy Russell.

**Founder and CEO of Eden Bio Dr Chris Reynolds commented**, "Eden Bio
is on a mission to tackle the low yield and scale up challenges
commercial protein production faces. I'm hugely proud of the results my
team has already achieved, and the amazing investors joining us are the
perfect complement of commercial, synthetic biology and AI expertise for
Eden Bio, helping us move even faster."

**Professor Richard Kitney, Director of SynBioVen, Co-founder of the
Imperial College Synthetic Biology Cluster, and Co-founder and
Co-Director of SynbiCITE, added,** "I'm most excited to work with Eden
Bio because of how the company is applying artificial intelligence and
machine learning to strain optimisation, an essential aspect of
synthetic-biology design."

Eden Bio's machine-learning platform technology enables the precision
fermentation industry to overcome the issues of low yield currently
preventing exciting protein products from making it to market. Dr
Christopher Reynolds, an entrepreneur with a PhD in bioinformatics, a
post-doctorate in bioengineering, and over twenty years as director of
software house Arc en Ciel, launched Eden Bio in Jan 2022. Prior to
that, he co-founded the precision fermentation dairy disruptor, Better
Dairy, in 2020, where he served as CTO.
