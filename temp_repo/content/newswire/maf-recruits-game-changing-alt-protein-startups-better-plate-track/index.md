MODIIN, Israel -- After concluding a highly successful first year, the
Modern Agriculture Foundation (MAF) announces that it has begun
accepting applications for the second cohort of its Better Plate
alternative protein track within MassChallenge Israel's 2023 Accelerator
program.

In addition to connecting the startups with top experts and industry
leaders, the accelerator aims to introduce the companies to relevant
technologies which can overcome hurdles within their own innovations.

An Israeli non-profit dedicated to advancing entrepreneurship and
innovation within the alternative protein industry in Israel and
globally, MAF launched Better Plate last year to fill a glaring vacuum
in the ecosystem. While Israel ranks second only to the United States in
terms of investment in the alternative protein sector, well-established
companies in more advanced stages are the overwhelming beneficiaries of
funding, leaving little leftover for young companies just starting out.

Until Better Plate's 2022 debut, no local accelerators catered to the
unique needs of alternative protein companies. "Better Plate does not
merely fill an acute need. It excels at doing so," said MAF CEO Levana
Shifman. "The tremendously successful outcome of last year's accelerator
clearly demonstrated the program's ability to assist early-stage
businesses as they grow from the ground up, providing them with high
quality mentors and expert guidance." Two out of the five Better Plate
cohorts were among 10 startups invited to join MCIL's roadshow to Boston
and New York, an outsized accomplishment among a pool of 42 startups
from all fields.

"Supporting young, pioneering companies as they develop into
accomplished gamechangers is in MAF's DNA. Not only is MAF the world's
first non-profit dedicated to promoting the interests of the alternative
protein industry, but in 2017, it hosted the world's first known
cultivated meat conference," said Shifman. "By partnering with
MassChallenge, which brings many years of experience running top-notch
accelerators, we ensure brilliant innovators tackling major global
challenges such as food security, the climate crisis and supply chain
issues, receive the best business resources and knowhow they need to
thrive."

"MAF's enriching and inspiring program in the MassChallenge Israel
Accelerator is an invaluable asset for early-stage alternative protein
companies, providing insight on creating effective pitch decks, finding
strategic partners and significant investors, getting a PoC with a
corporate, navigating the regulatory maze, going to market
internationally, and more," said Shalom Daniel, co-founder and CEO of
Mush Foods, one of the track's outstanding 2022 cohorts.

"Thanks to Better Plate, we got to know super talented foodtech
entrepreneurs, which was great for cross-fertilization and networking,"
recounted Maya Sapir-Mir and Raya Liberman Aloni, cofounders of PoLoPo,
one of the 2022 accelerator finalists. "It was clear the sessions were
custom-made for us."

industry with plant based, fermentation, cultured meat or other
sustainable food innovations are encouraged to submit their initial
application [here](https://apply.masschallenge.org/meetmc-israel-2023).
