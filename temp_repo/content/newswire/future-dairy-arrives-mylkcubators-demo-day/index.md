The first edition of [Mylkcubator](https://mylkcubator.com/), the
incubation program launched by [**Pascual
Innoventures**](https://pascualinnoventures.com/) in collaboration
with[** Eatable Adventures**](https://www.eatableadventures.com/), has
held its eagerly anticipated Demo Day event showcasing the advances of
the first cohort of startups, at its headquarters in Manoteras, Madrid.

The program not only showcased pioneering dairy projects around the
world but also **laid the foundation for a new path of development and
innovation for the industry** to face some of its greatest challenges.

As a culmination of the six-month incubation program, the participating
startups presented their final pitches, **paving the way for future
funding rounds** that will allow them to pursue their innovative
development and research:

-   **[De Novo Dairy,](https://denovodairy.com/) a startup** based in
    South Africa with a mission to create the future of nutrition, the
    company uses precise fermentation technology to produce animal-free
    dairy proteins that provide the same sensory experience and
    nutrition as traditional dairy counterparts. De Novo Dairy is
    currently developing high-value proteins for the dairy industry.
-   Spanish startup [**Real Deal
    Milk**](https://www.realdealmilk.com/) develops casein and whey
    proteins through precision fermentation technologies with the same
    functional properties as traditional dairy components, with the aim
    to produce dairy substitutes equivalent to traditional dairy.
-   Using bioengineering & microbial fermentation, [**Zero Cow
    Factory**](https://zerocowfactory.com/) is reinventing dairy
    ingredients with India's first milk and milk products (certainly the
    world's first A2 milk protein) using bioengineering the microbes &
    microbial fermentation. The Zero Cow team is developing a
    proprietary technique to recreate milk proteins to develop real
    dairy products that are ethical, safe, delicious, and identical to
    cow milk.
-   **Pure™ Mammary Factors** based in the USA are accelerating the
    state of the art in cell-cultured dairy by crashing the cost of
    production by the development of growth factors used in culture
    media. The startup aims to make cell-cultured human milk affordable
    and accessible by selling food-grade off-the-shelf growth factors
    around the world.

**Pascual Innoventures** is committed to driving innovation to create a
more sustainable future for all, anticipating the current trends that
will shape the foods of the future. Due to the success of the first
edition of Mylkcubator, Pascual Innoventures has already announced the
call for the second edition of the program.

According to **Sejal Ravji**, director of Pascual Innoventures, *"the
success of the Mylkcubator Demo Day not only reaffirms the great
response this program has had in the sector worldwide but also confirms
what we at Innoventures already knew, in order to develop the dairy
products of the future we have to continue to invest in transformational
innovation and ambitious technological projects, as is the case with the
four startups that have been working with us since the start of
Mylkcubator six months ago".*

Furthermore, according to **Jose Luis Cabañero**, founder and CEO of
Eatable Adventures, *"In the coming years, we expect to see increased
innovation in the alternative protein space, with breakthroughs in
cellular agriculture and precision fermentation technologies.
Mylkcubator is a pioneering global program that is and will continue to
be at the forefront of developing the dairy of the future."*
