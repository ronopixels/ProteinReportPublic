June 17, 2022 --- SeaSpire, an Indian alternative seafood startup, today
revealed its clean label whole-cut snapper alternative made using only
seven clean label plant-based ingredients using its proprietary
bioprinting platform. The company claims to be first of its kind to
produce bioprinted whole-cut whitefish products in the APAC region, a
region lagging in both product and processing innovations in the
alternative seafood segment.

SeaSpire is a foodtech company that produces whole cuts of seafood
alternatives, starting with whole cut snapper analogs. The company was
founded to help address the current challenges in whole-cut production
and scalability of 3D printing with its technology platform that is
capable of structuring both plant and synthetic biomass such as
cultivated meat into whole-muscle through AI-controlled precision and 
improving production scale by increasing throughput from current scale
of 3D printing. 

The company is establishing an operational base in India to cater to the
APAC region. The plant-based meat consumer adoption in the
Indian-subcontinent is on its rise and the company is  optimistic that
this region will also experience similar growth in demand across the
alternative

Seafood category  in the coming years. They have their R&D base in New
Zealand where they conduct technology development  within New Zealand's
sound innovation ecosystem. With a rich heritage in food tech and animal
proteins and strong Oceania brand story as a legacy protein producer
working towards a sustainable protein transition. 

Over the coming months the company will pilot-launch its first set of
plant-based seafood offerings in India and New Zealand starting with a
plant-based whole-cut snapper filets and focus on building an
alternative-seafood brand in the emerging APAC markets including
Singapore and Australasia. 

"\-- *We see greenfield  opportunities when it comes to alt-seafoods in
the largest seafood consuming regions like India and south-east Asia.
Weaim to drive category growth in this region with  a range of healthy
and delectable alt-seafood starting with our whole-muscle whitefish
fillets\', says co-founder Shantanu Dhangar.*

SeaSpire focuses on technologies that can displace the inefficiencies
with seafood production with a strong emphasis on the global food supply
towards a circular economy. The company is investigating potential of
upcycled horticultural side streams to develop feedstock for their
alternative seafood wholecuts. 

*"\--We need smart proteins and even a smarter production infrastructure
to address sustainable food transition for future generations. Reducing
supply chain stress, ingredient innovations and upcycling feedstock are
supporting pillars for our success at SeaSpire", says co-founder Varun
Gadodia. *

*The company will be showcasing its products at Tomorrow's Protein
Summit - by XPRIZE Foundation later this year and is aiming for its
plant-based whitefish wholecuts market launch in early 2023.*
