**Beijing** -- On Tuesday, China\'s main economic regulator unveiled a
five-year plan to boost the bioeconomy, highlighting alternative protein
sources as a critical sector to grow in order to achieve food security
and decarbonisation goals.

The 14th Five-Year Plan released by the National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC) included a call to develop "synthetic biology
technology to explore the research and development of 'artificial
protein' and other new food products and to realize the
industrialization of food iteration upgrade and reduce the pressure on
environmental resources brought by the traditional farming industry".

According to the NDRC, the development of \'artificial protein\' or
alternative protein would assist China attain national food safety while
also contributing to the sustainability of its food system.

"The government has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the
alternative protein sector and supported its advancement by providing
support for businesses and investors and promoting further development
of the industry", said Cecilia Zhao, Project Manager at Lever China.
"Alternative protein will play a vital role in helping the country
achieve carbon neutrality and build a secure food system and Lever China
will eagerly continue to work with startups and entrepreneurs to
accelerate the transition to more diverse, healthy and sustainable
sources of protein".  

In recent years, alternative protein has received a lot of attention in
China. In his speech in March, President Xi JinPing stated that the
country "should expand from traditional crops and livestock resources to
richer biological resources, develop biotechnology and biological
industries, and ask for calories and proteins from plants, animals and
microorganisms". The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs\' new
Five-Year Plan, released in 2020, called for "research and development
in cultured meat, plant-based eggs, milk, and oil, as well as
recombinant protein technology".
