*Orbillion Bio to become the eighth member of the Alliance for Meat,
Poultry & Seafood Innovation, a coalition of food companies dedicated to
producing meat, poultry and seafood directly from animal cells.*

WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 15, 2021) -- **The Alliance for Meat, Poultry &
Seafood Innovation (AMPS Innovation)** announced the addition of a new
member company, [**Orbillion Bio**](https://www.orbillion.com/). Founded
in August 2019 by [**BlueNalu**](https://www.bluenalu.com/), [**Finless
Foods**](https://finlessfoods.com/), [**Fork &
Goode**](https://www.forkandgoode.com/),
[**JUST**](https://www.ju.st/en-us), and [**UPSIDE
Foods**](https://www.upsidefoods.com/), Orbillion Bio becomes the eighth
member of AMPS Innovation in addition to **[Artemys
Foods](https://artemysfoods.com/)** and **[New Age
Meats](https://www.newagemeats.com/)** who joined the Alliance in July
2020. AMPS Innovation is a coalition of cell-cultured meat, poultry, and
seafood companies focused on educating consumers and stakeholders about
their new industry and advocating for a clear path to market for
their products.

Orbillion Bio was founded in 2019 by Patricia Bubner, PhD, Samet
Yildirim, MSc, MBS, and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD and will focus on
bringing premium cell-cultured meat such as wagyu beef, elk, sheep, and
American bison to market. With the addition of Orbillion Bio, AMPS
Innovation will continue coordinated efforts to engage key policymakers
and stakeholders to educate them on their products and work with
Congress, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) as they continue to build out a regulatory
framework for cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood.

"We're committed to crafting cell-cultured meat that consumers trust and
feel good about. That's why we're joining AMPS Innovation," said Samet
Yildirim, Orbillion Bio Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer. "As a
member of the coalition, we're thrilled to work with industry partners
to communicate with consumers, educate industry stakeholders, and inform
a clear path to market."

For nearly two years, AMPS Innovation has met and engaged with numerous
policymakers on both sides of the aisle and continued productive
conversations with USDA and FDA. AMPS Innovation also has worked closely
with representatives from the traditional meat and seafood industries --
North American Meat Institute and the National Fisheries Institute -- to
send letters to the USDA and FDA to [solicit
input](https://ampsinnovation.org/amps-innovation-and-nami-letter-to-fsis/)
on what that labeling should look like through an Advance Notice of
Public Rulemaking and [in
response](https://ampsinnovation.org/nfi-ampsinnovation-fda-comments-030821/)
to the FDA's Labeling of Foods Comprised of or Containing Cultured
Seafood Cells Request for Information, respectively.

All eight member companies, and other companies in this new and emerging
industry expect to make products available in the U.S. soon through
appropriate regulatory pathways. AMPS Innovation member companies are
committed to being a central, unified resource for consumers,
stakeholders and policymakers as their industry advances. Building on
progress over the past year, AMPS Innovation will continue to serve as
the voice of the industry as it establishes itself as a safe,
sustainable complement to the traditional meat, poultry and
seafood markets.
