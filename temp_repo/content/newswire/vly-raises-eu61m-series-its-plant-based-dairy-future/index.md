**Berlin, Germany 20th May 2021 CEST:**
[Vly](https://www.vlyfoods.com/), provider of a pea-based milk
alternative, has today announced an investment of €6.1M from FoodTech
investors Five Seasons Ventures, alongside previous investors Global
Founders Capital and Good Seed Ventures. The investment will be used to
scale in DACH and new European markets, including the UK, further
product development and key talent.

Vly was founded in 2018 by Niklas Katter, Moritz Braunwarth and Nicolas
Hartmann, who saw an opportunity for a healthy milk alternative that was
high in protein, low sugar, and didn't use any ingredients associated
with common allergies, such as nuts or oats. Valuing health and
innovation from within the company, the co-founders also wanted the
product to offer a more sustainable alternative without compromising on
taste.

After 400 iterations in research and development, vly was created using
yellow split pea protein. The finished product is neutral in taste, high
in nutrients, low in sugars, and is functional, meaning it can be used
for everything from frothy coffee to cereal. It's also more sustainable,
just 1L of vly uses 15x less CO2, 13x less water and 5x less land,
compared to cow's milk. 

**Nicolas Hartmann, Managing Director and Co-founder of vly,
commented,** "From the beginning health has been a critical component of
our vision for vly, experimenting with macro and micronutrients for the
optimal product. We continue to invest in research and development for
our products, innovating from within the company every day and staying
close to the process. We have started with milk, but we want to create a
range of new dairy alternative products, providing tasty and healthy
options that will accelerate the plant-based shift. This funding and the
industry expertise of our investors play a key part in moving us forward
in this mission."

Launched in Germany in January 2020 vly has experienced significant
growth, scaling from the shelves of 25 stores to 10,000 after just 12
months, including major German supermarkets, such as Rewe and Edeka. Vly
is already the sixth biggest plant milk brand in Germany and the company
is also serving customers in Austria, Estonia, the Netherlands, and
Switzerland. In addition to retailers and hospitality, it offers a
direct-to-consumer service through its website which covers roughly 20
per cent of its business.

The Series A round will primarily be used to capitalise on vly's growth
to date, cementing itself in its existing markets before fuelling
further expansion into international markets. The team of 15 based in
Germany will be hiring across research and science, product development,
marketing and sales, aiming to be 40 by the end of 2021. Vly will
continue to grow its R&D platform and expand into further product
categories such as its chocolate drink and fermented products that will
launch in 2021.

**Niccolo Manzoni, Founding Partner of Five Seasons Ventures**, lead
investor for the Series A round, added, "We scanned the entire European
market for an innovative dairy alternative and decided to invest in vly
because of its superior nutrition, functional profile and impressive
team. In such a short period of time vly has experienced exceptional
traction in the market. We see huge potential for the vly team, who are
committed to making category-defining plant-based products." 

Vly is available for online purchase to customers in Germany and
Austria, and soon further European countries. Vly's range includes three
products - Original, Unsweetened, and Barista (designed to foam better).
Prices start from €2.50 per carton.
