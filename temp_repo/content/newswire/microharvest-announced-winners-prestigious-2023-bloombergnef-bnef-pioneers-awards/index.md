**Hamburg, April 17th 2023** -- Agrifoodtech start-up
[MicroHarvest](https://microharvest.com/), a leading biotech company on
a mission to build the sustainable food system of tomorrow, has been
named as winning innovator for its response to the challenge of
'Building a net-zero food production system' by a panel of expert judges
at the prestigious 2023 BloombergNEF (BNEF) Pioneers awards.

With competition from almost 350 applications received by the BNEF, the
Hamburg-and-Lisbon-based company proved its credentials amongst
worldwide peers by offering a novel, scalable and competitive solution
to tackling the challenge of building towards a net-zero economy. The
company\'s development of technology able to harness the power of
microorganisms to produce nutritious and sustainable protein was judged
against three criteria: its potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions
and environmental sustainability, its degree of technology innovation
and novelty, and its likelihood of adoption and potential scalability.
MicroHarvest's highly efficient protein production process suitably
impressed the judges, earning the company its place alongside a
prestigious group of Pioneer awards alumni.

This proprietary technology -- based on biomass fermentation -- enables
production at a speed and efficiency that far exceeds other existing
approaches. The result is quality protein ingredients containing over
60% raw protein, that can be produced within 24 hours from input to
output. Possible applications along the whole protein value chain are
manifold, ranging from animal feed to direct application in food and pet
food.

The company operates within the accelerating segment of
fermentation-enabled alternative protein that attracted \$3.69Bn
investment in the last decade, with a 37% increase in Europe in 2022.
Aside from the booming alternative protein market for human food,
MicroHarvest ingredients will also serve a pet food market estimated to
grow to over \$130Bn by 2030 - and a \$62Bn aquafeed market.

**Katelijne Bekers, MicroHarvest Co-Founder & CEO**, commented on the
announcement: "To be awarded this prestigious Pioneers prize by the BNEF
amongst such impressive competition is something that we're extremely
proud of. The MicroHarvest team have made significant progress in
overcoming the challenges associated with scaling biotechnological
processes. We're developing technology that fuels the resilient food
system of tomorrow producing the nutritious and sustainable protein
ingredients that the world will need in a very near future. We have
already successfully completed a production trial at scale within our
first two years, which is an exceptional speed in the
fermentation-enabled alternative protein space. Based on our results to
date, we are confident that we can marry the sustainability and scale
necessary to become a champion of future protein in the B2B ingredients
industry.\"

**Claire Curry, selection committee co-chair and global head of
Technology, Industry & Innovation research at BloombergNEF**, stated:
"The search for new climate-technology solutions has never been as
urgent. Technologies under development now must scale by 2030 if they
are to play a significant role in helping reach net-zero emissions by
2050. Over the past three cycles of the Pioneers competition, we have
chosen to focus on innovation areas where there are particularly large
decarbonization hurdles. My belief is that our 2023 winners have the
technology edge, the talent and the right support systems to play a
significant role in overcoming the hurdles in scaling green hydrogen,
producing sustainable metals at scale and in decarbonizing our food
production system. We have now had 141 Pioneers winners since 2010, many
of which have played an essential role in the energy and climate
transition since their win. I look forward to seeing our 2023 winners do
the same in the next decade."

**About Microharvest**

MicroHarvest is a biotechnology company that produces sustainable
proteins through microbial fermentation, using agricultural byproducts
as feedstock. Their proprietary technology allows them to produce
protein ingredients much faster and using significantly less water and
space compared to animal or plant-derived ingredients. The dried biomass
is then combined with other ingredients to make food products, with
applications ranging from feed to pet food and human food. 

The company was founded in April 2021 and is led by CEO Katelijne
Bekers, Executive MBA with a background in biotechnology, CTO Luisa Cruz
PhD, bringing over 10 years leading R&D roles and COO Jonathan Roberz,
an experienced entrepreneur who has already successfully built and
exited a technology start-up.

Their ambition is to boldly push technological boundaries in the
ingredients industry to drive impact across the whole protein value
chain.
