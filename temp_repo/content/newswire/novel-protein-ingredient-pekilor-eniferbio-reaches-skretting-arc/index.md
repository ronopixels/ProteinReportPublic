Skretting is one step closer to validating a new novel ingredient and
reaching our Sustainability RoadMap 2025 ambition. eniferBio, the
Finnish biotech start-up and winner of the 2020 Nutreco Feed & Food Tech
Challenge, today announced the successful completion of process piloting
trials and the beginning of the next phase - testing of its Pekilo
mycoprotein in its R&D facilities at Skretting Aquaculture Research
Centre (ARC) in Norway.

"We have been working closely with the eniferBio team to support them
and help speed up the process to receive a commercially relevant novel
ingredient for the first validation at our salmon R&D facilities in
Norway," says Jenna Bowyer, Category Manager Novel Ingredients,
Skretting. "Our desktop assessment verified the potential of this
ingredient to be an alternative protein source to marine and soy
proteins in our aquafeeds. This is another example of Skretting's
commitment to identifying, developing and commercialising novel
ingredients that can have a positive contribution to the sustainability
of the aquaculture industry."

To produce the quantity required for Skretting testing, eniferBio teamed
up with Tereos, a global leader in the sugar, alcohol and starch
markets. Tereos provided the raw material for the trial, in the form of
vinasse, a by-product from the production of ethanol from beet molasses.
The process of eniferBio allows the efficient conversion of dilute side
streams such as vinasse into a valuable protein ingredient for
aquaculture feed.

"This is a very important step for us as company as we re-establish the
Pekilo production process, now as a major source of aquafeed protein,"
says Simo Ellilä, CEO of eniferBio. "We believe the process is unique in
offering a cost-competitive, sustainable alternative to soy protein
concentrate. The process is very scalable, and Pekilo can be produced
close to the end users -- promising to decrease dependence on imported
protein. This pilot trial is an excellent example of bringing together
the whole value chain in Europe. It has been an absolute pleasure making
this happen with the great teams at Tereos and Skretting."

The Pekilo protein now continues onto salmon feeding trials at Skretting
ARC, in Stavanger, Norway.

Last year, eniferBio was crowned the winner in the [Nutreco Feed & Food
Tech
Challenge](https://www.nutreco.com/en/innovation-and-investments/competition-nftc/).
The competition acknowledges the best breakthrough innovations within
livestock farming, aquaculture and alternative food proteins, and is
hosted by Nutreco, Skretting's parent company. The grand prize included
a scientific validation trial, and Skretting is excited to run the first
tests with this product with the ultimate aim of commercialisation.

As part of Nutreco's ambitious Sustainability RoadMap launched earlier
this year, Skretting has committed to an inclusion of 5-10% ingredients
from alternative novel sources by 2025.
