*Vienna, Austria, December 23, 2022* -- Austria-based ingredients
startup Arkeon turns CO2 into next-generation protein ingredients and
**raises another €4+ million** to do more, sooner. 

Launched just over a year ago, Vienna-based tech startup Arkeon has
secured additional capital investments to build out its CO2 utilization
technology for converting carbon dioxide directly into protein
ingredients. After the company had successfully closed its seed round
with leading food and climate tech investors in the beginning of the
year, key milestone achievements led the company to secure additional
resources from new strategic investors, including ICL, aws
Gruenderfonds, FoodHack and Tet Ventures. 

With more than €10 million in overall funding to date, the capital will
be allocated towards further investments in product development,
technology buildout, and infrastructure expansion. This includes a new
R&D hub to accelerate the scaling of Arkeon's production process, while
setting the course for industrial applications of the
company's products. 

**"We are thrilled about the support we are getting from our new
strategic partners as well as the strong commitment of our existing
investors to make sustainable production of protein ingredients a
reality"**, says Dr. Gregor Tegl, Co-Founder and CEO of Arkeon. 

With a team that comprises of world-leading archaea biologists, process
engineers, food scientists, and fermentation technologists, the company
sets out to change food production on a global scale. Using an
innovative technology that does not rely on land, animals, or large
quantities of water, Arkeon enables companies to improve existing
products, create new ones, and lessen their carbon footprint. 

The company's customizable B2B products can be used as clean label
ingredients for food and beverages, alternative proteins, flavours and
aromas, supplements, as well as cell culture media for cultivated meat.
By producing nutritious, functional, and sustainable protein
ingredients, Arkeon allows the transformation of resource-intensive
industries into sustainable, low-emission systems.
