-   First dedicated food-grade precision fermentation laboratories in
    Singapore and amongst few in the world truly catered towards
    start-ups and emerging food tech companies
-   Offering end-to-end Contract Development Manufacturing Organisation
    (CDMO) services from lab to market, including business and technical
    advisory, industry partnerships and investor access
-   Backed by ADM and Temasek's Nurasa, formerly Asia Sustainable Foods
    Platform

**Singapore, 26 October 2022 -** ScaleUp Bio, a new, Singapore-homegrown
precision fermentation solutions provider -- a joint venture company of
ADM and Temasek's Nurasa -- is positioning itself to emerge as a key
enabler towards unlocking innovation for global food tech start-ups
needing dedicated food-grade precision fermentation laboratory
facilities and more.

ScaleUp Bio will open two dedicated food-grade precision fermentation
facilities in Singapore during 2023. These new facilities will be the
first of their kind in Singapore open to promising start-ups from
anywhere in the world needing research and development assistance.

"Addressing urgent food security and supply issues driven by climate
change and exacerbated by traditional food production sources -- and in
line with emerging consumer demands for more sustainably developed
alternative proteins and other foods -- has been a real challenge due to
a lack of dedicated food-grade laboratory facilities, business guidance
and market assistance for start-ups," said Francisco Codoñer, ScaleUp
Bio CEO.

"This has been because most CDMOs around the world cater first and
foremost to pharmaceutical or biofuel industry needs. Which means
start-ups and other early-stage firms often must resort to expensive and
unpredictable laboratory capacities, often in an environment that was
not meant for food. Building their own pilot facilities on the other
hand would set up a high capital threshold out of the gate. We have
designed ScaleUp Bio's entire business model specifically to empower
these young companies with the facilities, capabilities, and resources
they have long needed to scale and succeed in today's marketplace."

**Two world-class, dedicated food-grade precision fermentation
facilities opening in 2023**

ScaleUp Bio's first facility opening in the first half of 2023 will be a
joint laboratory developed under a new, multi-year partnership with the
Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR)'s
Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation (SIFBI),
enabling delivery of tailored start-up infrastructure and service
offerings. This facility, designed especially for research and
development for start-ups and emerging food tech companies, will be able
to support up to 100 litres of fermentation and downstream processing
capacity, with analysis, testing and process optimisation capabilities.
It will be located at Nurasa's Food Tech Innovation Centre (FTIC) at
Biopolis, a research and development hub in central Singapore.

The second facility -- also scheduled for commercial launch during the
second half of 2023 -- will offer close to 2,300 square metres of space
where start-ups and early-stage food tech companies from around the
world can access up to 10,000 litres of fermentation and associated
downstream processing capacity, with experts on-hand to continue the
process optimisation and scale-up journey. This facility will also serve
as ScaleUp Bio's headquarters and will be located at LOGOS Food21, in
Tuas, an emerging food manufacturing zone in the western part of
Singapore.

Beyond physical laboratory facilities and technical expertise, ScaleUp
Bio also offers food tech startups a comprehensive array of
opportunities from its extensive business ecosystem.

**Offering access to Asia and an innovation ecosystem supported by
global leaders**

"We understand the challenges faced by young firms seeking to navigate
the complex regulations, cultures, and tastes across Asia. Thus, it
makes perfect sense for us to launch our global offering from Singapore.
From here, we can offer smart market entry to fast-growing Asian
populations hungry for alternative sustainable food sources from one of
the world's great innovation centres," Codoñer emphasised.

Through a holistic ecosystem of industry experts, partner organisations
and resources from across ScaleUp Bio's parent companies, precision
fermentation start-ups will have access to an unprecedented array of
resources and potential relationships to ensure commercial success. ADM
is a global leader in nutrition and agricultural origination and
processing and Nurasa is a new company focused on accelerating the
commercialisation and adoption of sustainable food across Asia and is in
turn wholly owned by Temasek, a global investment management company in
Singapore.

"Whether you are a home-grown innovator here in Singapore or from across
Asia -- or a food tech company from anywhere in the world -- we want to
hear from you. With our new facilities, access to top-tier talent,
resources, and capital, we offer a tremendous platform for young
companies seeking to springboard their products to global scale and
success," concluded Codoñer.
