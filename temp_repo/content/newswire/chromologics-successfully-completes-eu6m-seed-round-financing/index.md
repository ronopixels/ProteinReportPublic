Chromologics is developing a bio-based portfolio of natural colorants
via a fungal biotech platform for the food market, tapping into a € 4.6B
market opportunity.

The company received an additional € 4M from Blue Horizon Ventures, Novo
Seeds, Nordic Food Tech, and angel investor Giampaolo Cagnin. The total
seed round, which also included Vækstfonden, was € 6M.

Chromologics was founded in 2017 as a spin-out from the Technical
University of Denmark. Since closing their initial seed round in July
2020, they have expanded the team, improved their production yields,
engaged with customers, and initiated the regulatory approval of their
flagship product, a natural red food color. This new investment not only
strengthens the company's initial strategic vision, but also allows
Chromologics to explore and expand the portfolio to address other market
segments.

The market for food coloring has continuously moved from synthetic to
natural solutions over the last decade. Two main challenges for the
natural colorants include compliance with vegan certification standards
and, crucially, temperature stability to accommodate food manufacturing
processes.

Chromologics' platform sets a new benchmark for food colorant
production. It supports the transition from the input-intensive and
wasteful use of food resources towards sustainable, laboratory-grown
food colorants. Instead of exploiting high-value crops and insects to
extract natural colorants, Chromologics' natural colorants are produced
using precision fermentation. Chromologics is thus freeing up arable
land for other crucial foods and decreasing the use of pesticides and
fertilizers.

Chromologics is actively forming partnerships and collaborations with
food manufacturers, especially those working on new plant-based meat
products, to test and evaluate the Chromologics' natural red colorant
solution.

**Gerit Tolborg / CEO Chromologics**\
*"I am proud to be CEO and co-founder of Chromologics, and proud to be
among the few female CEO's of tech start-ups. Our journey of
successfully translating academic science into a commercial product is
just beginning. Our ambition is to grow Chromologics into the market
leader of fermented natural color solutions, and at the same time be an
inspiration for other female scientists to follow suit."*

**Thomas Grotkjær / Novo Seeds**\
*"The extended seed round, with participation of new European investors
with strong domain expertise, is a clear sign of the momentum of
Chromologics. I believe that Chromologics has the potential to drive a
significant change in how we think about natural colors."*

**Regina Hecker / Blue Horizon Ventures**\
*"What the Chromologics team is doing is absolutely fascinating. Their
technology has the potential to radically transform the global color
industry as it opens the door for nature-based, safe, and reliable
colors to the food and beverage industry that can be produced with far
fewer resources. We are delighted to support them on this journey."*

**Lauri Reuter / Nordic Food Tech VC**\
*"Chromologics has set a great example both in leveraging biology to
solve a hard technical problem for better food and in turning excellent
research into a fast-growing company. An absolute delight for an
investor."*

**About**

**The Founders**\
Gerit Tolborg and Anders Ødum met in 2016 at the Technical University of
Denmark (DTU), when they were both pursuing academic careers. After an
exciting discovery of a novel group of fungal pigments during Gerit's
PhD, they founded Chromologics. Financed by several soft money grants
from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Innovation Foundation Denmark,
Gerit and Anders matured the technology of Chromologics to attract
international venture capital.

Chromologics is a Danish biotech spin-out from the Technical University
of Denmark, based in Copenhagen and founded in 2017. They have developed
a fungal biotech platform to produce novel, natural colorants. Their
proprietary fermentation process allows them to be first movers to
introduce lab-grown food colorants to the market. Their production is
sustainable, scalable, and cost-competitive. Their pigments are
compatible with most dietary needs, including kosher, halal, and vegan
diets. [www.chromologics.com](http://www.chromologics.com)
