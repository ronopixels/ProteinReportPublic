**Brooklyn, New York** --- Newlab, the center for applied innovation
bringing together experts, industry, and civic leaders to solve systemic
challenges with transformative technologies, today announced the launch
of their new cellular agriculture venture studio.

*By Clair Purcell, Newlab's Chief Venture Builder*

Like many adventures, it started as a conversation between strangers at
the back of a bus.

I was at the [Ferment Conference](https://ginkgoferment.com/) heading to
check out Ginkgo Bioworks foundry, speaking to Bre, the Research
Operations and Outreach Director from [New
Harvest](https://new-harvest.org/), which I'd later discover is the
leading field building organization for cellular agriculture.

*'There's not enough B2B businesses in cellular agriculture. Everyone
wants to be the one making the chicken nuggets...'*

My ears perked up. One week into my new role as Chief Venture Builder at
Newlab, I was working out how to scale Newlab's new business-building
capabilities, particularly ones that will have a positive impact on
planetary health. What I love about *intentional* business-building is
that there are so many impactful opportunities that aren't noticed by
entrepreneurs because they're not as trendy or visible as...
chicken nuggets.

**The time is right to build infrastructure businesses to scale
cellular agriculture.**

It was the start of a deep dive into the space of growing animal
products without the animal--otherwise known as lab-grown or post-animal
production: real beef and leather without killing a cow and real milk
without milking one. It's a wonderful, hugely impactful, and extremely
complex industry that has the potential to eliminate [10-14 gigatonnes
of carbon emissions per year](http://gfi.org/climate), eradicate animal
abuse, and deliver nutritious, high-quality
[meats](https://www.bluenalu.com/),
[clothing](https://recruit.galy.co/), and
[ingredients](https://www.melibio.com/) to humans in a sustainable way.

The cellular agriculture industry is on the cusp of mainstream adoption:

1.  The science is shifting from proof of possibility to a focus on cost
    reduction. Inventors in this space have come a long way from the
    first lab-grown burger, which cost a whopping \$400k. Even if you're
    a skeptic on the claims of today's companies making it for \~\$7/kg
    (or \~\$1.50/burger), the downward trend line is clear. Large
    infrastructure companies focused on delivering single pieces of the
    puzzle at scale for multiple customers will further push these
    techno-economics downward.
2.  Around the corner from cost reduction is scale. [Today's businesses
    will need to scale at 70% per year, every year for the next 10 years
    just to capture 1% of the global meat
    market](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan).
    Early entrants by necessity are vertically integrated. New entrants
    need an ecosystem that helps them focus on their unique value
    proposition, not reinvent the wheel on the infrastructure needed to
    do so.
3.  Only
    [40%](https://admin-21183.medium.com/state-of-the-industry-8b4f5e2826b4)
    of the companies in the field today are B2B businesses. For
    capital-intensive industries like hardware and biotech, this is
    usually closer to 80-90%. B2B businesses have a lot of catching up
    to do to enable the level of scale needed.
4.  Regulatory approval is on the (far?) horizon. Singapore was the
    first country in the world to regulate serving lab-grown meat, with
    [many others tipped to
    follow](https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-regulation-2021/). This
    includes the U.S., who has partnered with the FDA and USDA to work
    through how to regulate.
5.  Growth in investments has increased dramatically (\$1.3BN in 2021,
    up 336% from 2019). This indicates a broader recognition by the
    investment community of the dynamics discussed above and potentially
    smoother pathways to raising capital for large
    infrastructure projects.
6.  Reinvention of the way we make animal products has only just begun.
    We're only just beginning to explore the areas where the cellular
    agriculture approach could be applied. A single application could
    upend an entire industry (e.g. [palm oil](https://www.c16bio.com/),
    [baby formula](https://www.biomilq.com/), and commodity foods like
    [chocolate](https://www.cacultured.com/)). If  the natural resources
    and ethical constraints around certain foods are removed, we might
    see an uptick in the diversity of food options ([lion steaks or
    tiger tacos](https://www.primevalfoods.co/revolution) anyone?).

Thousands of businesses need to be, and will be, built in this space
over the next decade.

For that to become a reality, B2B businesses that make it easy to build
new CellAg products will be fundamental.

Over the past month, we've explored where B2B businesses will be most
impactful in reducing today's cost of beef per kilo, from
[\~\$22,000/kg](https://cedelft.eu/publications/tea-of-cultivated-meat/)
down to something cost competitive. We believe there are four key
focus areas:

1.  **Optimizing bioprocessing & production systems.** Creating proteins
    through cell culturing and precision fermentation is fraught with
    costly and inefficient processes that will be challenging to scale.
    We're exploring how this can be improved by examining closed-loop
    systems, decentralized production facilities, and improving
    hardware infrastructure.
2.  **Software and toolkits that enable simplicity in bioprocesses.**
    Most companies develop their own software and toolkits out of
    necessity to effectively operate their bioprocess equipment.
    Building out standardized and simplified software toolkits will
    enable production cost reductions, the output of better data, and
    automation within a given bioprocess flow.
3.  **Alternative manufacturing for proteins and inputs.** The majority
    of cell ag production processes involve cell culturing or precision
    fermentation. This opportunity area explores alternative
    manufacturing methods, such as molecular farming, yeast, and
    microalgae, and examines opportunities with cutting-edge
    technologies around 3D printing and scaffolds to create proteins and
    inputs more cost-efficiently.
4.  **Platform technologies for optimized ingredient discovery.** The
    'holy grail' of synthetic biology is to develop platform
    technologies that make the production of high-quality materials
    faster, cheaper, and more sustainable. This opportunity area
    investigates whether functional edible and non-edible proteins can
    be developed through platform technologies that can lend to
    applications within, and outside, cellular agriculture.

**Big businesses need a strong ecosystem to be successful.**

Venture Studios are powerful mechanisms for growing businesses that can
impact entire ecosystems. This is because they:

1.  Build the businesses that need to be built. What is most impactful
    is often not the most visible, hyped, or attractive. Venture studios
    start from a market need and develop concepts in response to
    that need.
2.  Derisk concepts early. Often, lone founders can spend months or
    years working on a concept only to discover that it doesn't work.
    Our venture building approach (a mix of lean, design, and agile
    methodologies with our own sprinkle of deep tech learnings) and
    access to industry pilot partners and experts means we learn early
    and cheaply what will be successful. We make fewer mistakes and move
    faster towards the right solution.
3.  Scale quickly. An early-stage startup needs to focus on two things:
    product validation and market fit. Newlab provides the mental and
    physical space to focus on what matters most in the crucial first 18
    months of a new company's life. Operations, recruitment, funding,
    branding--these are all things the Newlab team has been doing for
    years for our own company and the startups we support. Newlab's
    Brooklyn location has a brand new BioLab and we are actively
    exploring building out biotechnology-specific infrastructure
    in 2023.
4.  Build the dream team from the ground up. From the selection of
    Founders-in-Residence to headhunting CEOs or acting as the founding
    team ourselves, we build curated teams of people who are passionate,
    talented, and have the experience to scale up, not just start up.
    We're also proud to provide stipends and early funding to ensure
    that working on an early-stage startup is an accessible option to
    people from all walks of life, resulting in more diverse,
    successful teams.

All of this amounts to better chances of success; businesses built by
Venture Studios are more likely to get to Series A, and we get there
twice as fast (2 year vs 4 years). 

**Founders who work with venture studios are more likely to be
successful and expend less stress and wasted effort along the way.**

For an opportunity as large as scaling cellular agriculture, the first
step is to partner with people who bring other pieces of the puzzle that
are complementary to our own.

We've started with [Lejjy](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lejjygafour) from
CULT Food Sciences. The former CEO and founder of a YC-backed B2B
Cellular Agriculture business, Future Fields, and now CEO of one of the
most forward thinking VC companies we've ever had the pleasure of
working with, CULT is already building out a number of initiatives to
scale the cellular agriculture industry (including [The Cellular
Agriculture Network of Excellence](http://opencellag.com), [their own
Research](https://www.cultfoodscience.com/cell-x), and a [physical space
in
Canada](https://www.cultfoodscience.com/press-releases/cult-food-science-secures-space-for-the-development-of-an-incubation-studio-in-ontario)).

*"The venture studio provides a unique model that fits well with the
overall strategy of CULT Food Science --- it provides an avenue for new
ideas and IP to be developed from the ground up with skilled experts and
an eye for really pushing the boundaries of what has been done to date
with cellular agriculture. Between CULT Food Science and Newlab, we will
be a driving force for new innovations in the industry over the next few
years" --- Lejjy Gafour, CEO of CULT Food Science.*

**Our next step is... you?**

We're seeking people who fit a broader vision of who a founder can be: a
scientist, an inventor, or an operator, interested in building in a
highly collaborative environment.

Up to three people will have the opportunity to receive a monthly
stipend and work together with our Director of Venture Strategy,
[Abdul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdul-khogali/), over three to five
months to identify, validate, and prioritize businesses in the
opportunity areas outlined earlier. The top business/es will receive
funding and support from Newlab and CULT to launch and grow to the next
stage of funding. You'll be a part of the Newlab Community in Brooklyn
with full use of our biolab as well as access to Newlab and CULT experts
and mentors.

We envision someone who:

-   Has a background in biotechnology or life sciences
-   If an inventor, they have a potential technology that they'd like to
    see commercialized
-   Has a strong point of view of what's missing from the market and a
    vision for its economic viability
-   Believes that impactful solutions are strong investments
-   Prioritizes helping people at scale over one narrow focus
