Mogale Meat, a South-African cellular food-tech company, and their team
showcased Africa's first cultivated chicken on March 30th, 2022. This
action not only represents a first for Africa, but also the birth of a
major new technological drive to produce more essential animal protein
for people. Cultivated meat is a potential game-changer for the planet,
and more specifically for Africa's biodiversity and wildlife
conservation.

With the expanding population in Africa, which is expected to double in
the next 30 years, we are rapidly outstripping our ability to supply
affordable and nutritious food. Cultivated meat has the promise to
address food security and add nutritional value without further
high-impact agricultural practices that are having devastating effects
on Africa's biodiversity and wildlife.

In recent years we have seen the food industry pivot towards alternative
meat and sustainable sources of protein, with plant-based meat-like
products, and now cultivated meat coming onto the scene. Globally there
are already over 100 start-up companies working in the cultivated meat
space with billions of dollars being invested. It is thrilling that
South Africa is among those 100 companies and has achieved such a
significant milestone of showcasing Africa's first cultivated chicken.

Over the past 18 months Mogale Meat has been working tirelessly using
cutting-edge scientific research and innovation to produce cultivated
meat from free-roaming livestock and wildlife such as cattle, and
antelope. Although Mogale Meat's focus is on being a cultivated game
meat company, they have produced Africa's first chicken breast prototype
using cultivated meat technology in just 8 months to compete in the
global \$15million XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion competition. Mogale Meat
Co, the Managing Partner of the MeatOurFuture project, in collaboration
with Biotechnology and Food Science, Tshwane University of Technology
and the School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal is the only
semi-finalist team, of 31 teams, from the continent of Africa for this
prestigious competition. Each team was given a choice between chicken or
fish, and MeatOurFuture decided on chicken, as this is not only the most
popular meat in Africa but the most widely eaten meat worldwide.

Mogale Meat's vision is to make healthy and nutritious cell-based meat
accessible to all in Africa. The team is currently working on
prototyping a unique modular plug-and-play concept production plant that
will allow cultivated meat to be made where the people are. This will
not only provide the people across the continent of Africa with
affordable and nutritional animal protein but do so in a way that
conserves Africa's precious wildlife and biodiversity. The biggest
challenge Mogale Meat and other cultivated meat companies are currently
facing is firstly bringing down the cost to manufacture the meat at
scale, and secondly paving the way for regulatory approval. Although
cultivated meat is real meat, it does require policies surrounding food
safety, production, as well as trade to be updated to include
cell-cultured meat that is produced without the conventional way of
slaughtering live animals.

Cultivated meat is produced by taking a small biopsy from a living
animal and growing the cells in a bioreactor, much the same way that the
cells would grow in an animal, but much more efficiently and without the
addition of unwanted growth hormones, antibiotics, and other chemical
compounds. Producing meat through cell technology also means reducing
the environmental impact of raising more livestock to keep up with human
consumption demands. Less land has to be ploughed to feed animals in
feedlots, less water is required and most importantly wildlife and the
incredible biodiversity we have in Africa can be conserved by
transitioning to cultured meat production.

Dr Paul Bartels, a wildlife veterinarian, and the Founder and CEO of
Mogale Meat says "Mogale Meat Co is raising the bar by developing
BestByNature food technology that will not only impact the way people
view and eat healthy game meat, but also do so by supporting the
economic and social wellbeing of the wildlife industry, National Parks
and the communities living with wildlife." Mogale Meat aims to conserve
Africa's wildlife heritage through the provision of sustainable animal
protein for the people of Africa and the world through cultivated game
meat created from the cells of free-roaming antelope and cattle.

The cultivated chicken breast, composed of real chicken muscle and fat
cells blended with a mushroom matrix, is the first prototype Mogale Meat
will showcase. A signature wildlife meat product will be revealed later
in the year.

For Mogale Meat it is extremely exciting to be at the forefront of food
science and innovation on a global scale and a huge privilege not only
for South Africa but Africa as well. The Mogale Meat team strives to
improve the health, socio-economic and environmental impact of consumer
meat products, one meal at a time.
