*Shanghai-based HERO Protein, the first Chinese company to use
high-moisture extrusion technology, draws backing from senior food
industry execs and leading corporates*

**Shanghai** --- HERO Protein, the first domestic plant-based meat
company in China to use cutting-edge high-moisture extrusion technology,
announced today that it has completed a US\$850K pre-seed funding round
to launch its products into the market. The funding round saw
participation from Cremer, a leading global commodities and
co-manufacturing company; Lever China Fund, the most active alternative
protein investor in China; and senior executives from leading restaurant
brands.

HERO Protein's initial product range, which includes a variety of
plant-based beef and chicken products, was formulated specifically for
the Chinese market by a team of former senior R&D executives at Beyond
Meat, Impossible Foods, Gardein, Lightlife and Morningstar, the five
largest plant-based meat brands in North America. The application of
high moisture extrusion technology, which is common in the west but to
date has not been used by domestic brands in China, is particularly
critical for reproducing the juiciness and mouthfeel of meat.

The funding round will be used to advance the company's ongoing research
and development, to develop and scale production, and to expand
distribution. HERO Protein launched into the foodservice channel in
China in January.

*\"Plant-based meat is a rising and unstoppable trend in China,\"* said
HERO Protein CEO Edward Weng, who for the past fifteen years served as
VP of Sales and Marketing at Xiamen Zhongma, selling conventional meat
and other food products into leading QSR chains in China including KFC,
Starbucks and Burger King. \"*HERO Protein aims to bring together the
advanced food technology used by top international players such as
Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods and the domestic know-how to curate
delicious products specifically catered to the Chinese palate, at prices
affordable for a broader range of Chinese consumers. We are very pleased
to receive support from investors and partners who share our mission.\"*

*\"HERO Protein is proud to partner with leading domestic players in the
ingredients, logistics, production, food and retail industries,\"* said
HERO Protein COO Ludovic Shum, who previously worked as Marketing
Director at Carrefour China in charge of category management and new
concepts development, with 15 years of experience in the retail industry
at Carrefour France and China. *\"By localizing the production we ensure
product quality control and keep pricing affordable, allowing for
successful market penetration and growth.\"*

HERO Protein is the first domestic company in China to sell plant-based
meat products produced using high-moisture extrusion. Founded in 2020
and based in Shanghai, HERO Protein aims to become the leading brand
delivering a tasty and accessible range of plant-based meat products,
offering consumers the culinary experience of conventional meat while
ensuring food safety and sustainability. HERO Protein was recently named
to the International Future Agrifood 2020 Alternative Protein Top 20
list, and was a winner of TechNode Global's 2020 ORIGIN Innovation
Awards in the Food & AgriTech category.
