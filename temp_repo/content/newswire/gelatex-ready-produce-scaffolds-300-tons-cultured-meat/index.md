-   By developing a patented nanofiber production technology, Gelatex
    has solved one of the key scalability issues for producing cultured
    meat.
-   Gelatex is currently running pilots with the capacity to provide
    scaffolds for 300 000 kg of cultured meat annually.

**Techstars-backed materials technology company**
[**Gelatex**](https://www.gelatex.com/)** is on the mission to make
cultured meat available in supermarkets. As a pioneer in making
scaffolds for cultured meat, Gelatex has opened a new research,
engineering and manufacturing facility to take the development and
production of their nanofibrous materials to the next level. Thus,
removing one of the barriers in scaling cultured meat. **

Gelatex's scaffolds are produced using patented high-throughput
nanofiber technology. The company has increased their production
capacity to 5 kg/h while the alternative method of electrospinning
produces up to 360 g/h. Gelatex plans to double the volume by the end of
the year at their new facility in Tallinn, Estonia. Thus, providing
sufficient scaffolds for the manufacturing of 300 000 kg of cultured
meat annually.

"Nanofibers have been used for tissue engineering for a long time but
until now they have been expensive and difficult to scale. Therefore, no
viable solutions are available for cultured meat companies. At Gelatex
we solved scalable nanofibers manufacturing because of our own need at
first and are now glad to take off the table one challenge that needs to
be solved for cultured meat companies. Some cultured meat companies are
aiming to have a capacity of around 50-150 tons of meat per year already
this or next year. Considering this, Gelatex has sufficient capacity to
fulfill the annual scaffold demand for 3-4 first cultured meat companies
entering the production level," comments **CEO of Gelatex, Märt-Erik
Martens**. 

Gelatex's production does not need a large manufacturing complex: an
industrial machine capable of producing up to 5 kg/h of material
occupies less than 10 m2. The new quarters of only 370 m2 have
manufacturing, office space, labs (incl. chemistry, materials, and a
cell lab) and an equipment development and assembly center all under one
roof. In the future, the company wants to have lights-out manufacturing
requiring no human presence, as well as using green manufacturing
principles.

Considering the small footprint of production and rapid in-house
machinery development and manufacturing, the Gelatex team is confident
that they can stay ahead of the demand and keep up with the fast growth
of the industry. The goal is to make the final meat cost as much or even
less than conventional meat today. The company is currently in the
process of piloting with the leading cultured meat companies, testing
various plant-based ingredients to further optimize the product and
assure production and packaging according to the highest safety and
cleanliness standards. 

According to **Felipe Krelling, founding partner of Lifely VC**, who has
invested along Gelatex also in startups such as Cultured Decadence
(acquired by Upside Foods), WildType or Jellatech, cost-effective
production of cultured meat on a mass scale is a goal for the whole
industry. \"While supporting many cultivated meat projects around the
world, I've seen many breakthroughs in this space in the last years, but
scaffolding still remains a challenge both for scalability and costs.
That is why we were happy to invest in Gelatex which has a very
promising technology to enable the scalability of one very important
component in the final cultured meat production," says Krelling.

Gelatex has patented a novel high-capacity solution-spinning method and
device for nanofiber manufacturing to innovate cultured meat, wound
care, and many other industries. The material comes in rolls, is easily
scalable, up to 90% cheaper and is produced with 28% smaller electricity
consumption compared to market alternatives.

Although currently based in Estonia, Gelatex is aiming to have scaffold
manufacturing located close to the customer in different parts of the
world in the future.

*Gelatex Technologies is an experienced materials technology company
from Estonia and inventor of cost-effective technology for nanofiber
production. Their scalable platform technology enables the
implementation of nanofibers in applications that were inapproachable
until now such as scaffolds for cell-cultured meat, scar-reducing wound
care materials, bio-based filtration materials, and more. Gelatex was
founded in 2016 and raised €1.2M in 2021.*
