***Shanghai, China*** - Shanghai-based plant-based meat company
HEROTEIN's plant-based chicken, beef, and ready-to-eat meals have landed
on Carrefour shelves, as the only brand for this leading retailer.

**Carrefour launches HEROTEIN products**\
Since September, Carrefour stores in Eastern China have begun featuring
eight of HEROTEIN's signature products, including plant-based dumplings,
chicken nuggets, beef patties, microwave RTE pasta, etc. To deepen
interaction and understanding of the company's plant-based offerings
among the retail giant's staff, an internal product tasting and sharing
session was held at Carrefour headquarters. The partnership has also
seen the roll out of plant-based weekend activities across Carrefour
stores, inviting chefs to cook onsite and serve plant-based dishes to
customers, encouraging the first trial and converting immediate
purchase. Supported by successful launch and well-performed moving rate
in Eastern stores, Carrefour plans to distribute HEROTEIN products in
northern stores as the next step, by the end of 2022.

Carrefour's online channels, including the official APP, also offer
online ordering, realizing the integration of online and offline
channels to meet consumer demand for diversity and immediate service.

**Offline retail is the key driver of plant-based meat sales**\
While much has been made of online retail and the convenience it affords
to consumers, offline retail remains the top revenue-driving channel for
plant-based meats globally. Moving forward, to expand the market for
plant-based meat, development of the offline retail channel remains key,
hence the importance of the Carrefour/HEROTEIN partnership. Following
this partnership, HEROTEIN continues to penetrate more KA stores, and
their products have been available in BHG Beijing stores since November.
As an aside, while the food service channel was and continues to be
affected by the pandemic, the retail channel remains a broad consumer
market and engine of growth.

\"With regards to offline supermarkets, they are an important outlet for
daily shopping by consumers, and naturally have the advantage of
long-term retail experience. For the emerging category of plant-based
meat, retail channels perform better in market communication. Compared
to the foodservice channel, it's more conducive to brand image and
awareness,"said Vicky Lee, CEO of HEROTEIN.

**From niche to mainstream, the future of plant-based meat is
promising**\
Carrefour's first foray into plant-based meat with its exclusive local
partner HEROTEIN is a good indication that the alternative protein
category is starting to move into mainstream offline retail. It also can
be seen as a sign that once niche alternative protein category is
gaining growing acceptance, as it becomes a part of the daily diets of
regular consumers.

**ABOUT HEROTEIN**

[HEROTEIN](http://heroprotein.cn/) is the first domestic company in
China to sell plant-based meat products using high moisture extrusion.
Founded in 2020 and based in Shanghai, HEROTEIN aims to become the
leading brand delivering a tasty and accessible range of plant-based
meat products, offering consumers the culinary experience of
conventional meat while ensuring food safety and sustainability.
