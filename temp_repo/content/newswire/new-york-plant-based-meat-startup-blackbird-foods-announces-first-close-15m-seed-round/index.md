-   Investment led by Lever VC to allow Blackbird Foods to expand into
    retail chains and scale operations.
-   Blackbird Foods builds on early successes of supplying popular NYC
    restaurants with its plant-based protein to launch on grocery
    shelves nationwide.
-   Demand has already quadrupled within Blackbird's home region of the
    northeast since the start of 2020.

New York, NY February 18, 2020. \-- Blackbird Foods Inc., the
plant-based foods startup, has just announced its first close of a \$1.5
million seed round to grow the distribution of its wheat-based protein
products and hand-tossed frozen pizzas. In December 2020, Blackbird
expanded to the West Coast by launching at Erewhon, its first chain
outside of the Northeast region. It has plans to start rolling out into
more grocery chains nationwide in 2021.

Before securing its first seed round, CEO Emanuel Storch says that
Blackbird had to quadruple the output of its retail products in 2020 due
to the demand shift seen after the outbreak of COVID19. "Before the
pandemic, our core business was selling to restaurants. I quickly
realized that we had to pivot in order to meet the demands of consumers.
I built an eCommerce site overnight on Squarespace and partnered with
grocery distributors in New York to bring our products to more shelves,"
says Storch.

As sales started to grow month over month, Blackbird sought investment
from mission-driven investors like Lever VC, a Venture Capital firm
dedicated to alternative protein, and Sustainable Food Ventures led by
Ryan Bethencourt, founder of Wild Earth, a plant-based dog food company
featured on Shark Tank." The face of protein is changing. Sales of
plant-based meat and dairy products are soaring. We are excited to bring
these investors onboard at Blackbird, as the company demonstrably shows
how plant-based foods can be even better than their animal-based
counterparts with no sacrifice on flavor, texture, or even nutrition,"
adds Storch.

Blackbird has been recognized by renowned chefs like Guy Vaknin of
Beyond Sushi and Mathieu Palombino, Chef and owner of Motorino Pizzeria.
Motorino helped develop and uses Blackbird's plant-based sausage as a
pizza topping at all its locations. Chef Guy uses Blackbird's seitan in
multiple dishes including a take on steak frites at his new spot
'Willow' in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

All of this traction helped Blackbird get noticed by major retailers
like Whole Foods, Erewhon Central Market, Harmons, and Metropolitan
Markets, in which the company plans to start rolling out this Spring.
