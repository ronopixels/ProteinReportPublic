**Berlin/Shanghai, April 07, 2022.** To ensure the future supply of
animal protein to the constantly growing world population we need new
methods of food production. Globally, only a few companies are driving
cutting-edge R&D efforts to offer alternatives to the conventional
production of meat, fish, and poultry. They use animal cells to produce
tasty, sustainable products that eliminate animal suffering and promise
an ecological footprint far superior to that of factory farming.

Bluu Seafood (formerly Bluu Biosciences) and CellX, two pioneers in the
field of cellular agriculture, have now decided to work together. Bluu
Seafood is the first company in Europe specializing in the production of
cultivated fish and will present a first product this year. CellX is the
leading cultivated meat company in China and has showcased multiple
forms of products in 2021. The company is located in Shanghai, the hub
for biotech and innovation in China. It started with a focus on domestic
Chinese pig breed and has quickly expanded to beef and poultry. Both
companies are at the forefront of advancing regulatory approval in their
respective region: Chris Dammann, COO of Bluu Seafood, is a VP and board
member of Cellular Agriculture Europe, and Ziliang Yang, founder and CEO
of CellX, is Secretary of the APAC Society for Cellular Agriculture.
Bluu Seafood and CellX are now joining forces as part of a strategic
partnership. Going forward, the partners will support each other along
the whole value chain when expanding into the respective markets -- this
ranges from the procurement of raw materials to the construction of
production facilities and possible sales partnerships. They plan to
jointly establish supply partnerships and also promote consumer
acceptance of cultivated protein products. The two companies have a
different product focus but are committed to the same goal using similar
technologies to make cellular agriculture a reality.

\"We are pleased to form this strategic partnership with Bluu Seafood as
an industry leader in cultivated seafood and board member of Cellular
Agriculture Europe. CellX and Bluu Seafood have a complementary focus
regarding species and market geographies. This partnership will serve as
a starting point for deeper collaboration between the two companies and
will encourage more collaboration across the industry. We are solving a
global issue, and this requires a global solution,\" said Ziliang Yang,
CEO at CellX.

"China has the world\'s largest consumption of seafood and is therefore
a particularly important market for Bluu Seafood. Together with CellX,
we are working to overcome the challenges in sourcing, scaling, and
obtaining regulatory approval concerning cultivated fish and meat to
bring affordable and tasty products to market. We are delighted about
this Chinese-German partnership in which we are working together on the
future of food,\" emphasized Simon Fabich, founder and managing director
of Bluu Seafood.

The Berlin-based company is researching and developing at its second
location in Lübeck and will open up additional production capacities in
Hamburg this year.
