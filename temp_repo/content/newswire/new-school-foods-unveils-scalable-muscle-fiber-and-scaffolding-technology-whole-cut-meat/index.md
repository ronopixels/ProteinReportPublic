**February 2, 2023** **-- Toronto, Ontario --** Today, plant-based
seafood producer [New School Foods](https://www.newschoolfoods.co/)
publicly announced its proprietary, scalable technologies for the
plant-based meat industry, capable of producing whole-cut fish
alternatives that look and cook just like ordinary seafood. The company
also announced \$12 million USD in seed funding from global investors
including Lever VC, Blue Horizon, Hatch, Good Startup, Alwyn Capital,
Joyance Partners, as well as grants from multiple agencies, including
Protein Industry Canada.

For three years New School Foods CEO Christopher Bryson invested heavily
in academic R&D projects with some of the world's leading Food Science
Universities, and identified a scalable platform that delivers a number
of firsts for the meat alternative industry:

1.  **Muscle fibers, made from plants:** Replicates the diameter,
    length, strength and structure of fish muscle fibers to deliver the
    same texture & mouthfeel.
2.  **Whole-cut scaffolding:** Filets that combines directionally
    aligned muscle fibers with plant-based connective tissue, fats,
    colors, and flavors.
3.  **Raw-to-cooked:** Unlike nearly all other products in the market
    that are pre-cooked by production, New School Foods' cold-based
    processing technology creates a filet that starts raw and transforms
    like fish upon cooking.
4.  **Scalable by design:** Unlike many other new food processing
    technologies, New School Foods' process uses off-the-shelf equipment
    from adjacent industries, providing a superior ability to scale more
    globally.

The alternative protein market at large has yet to tackle the biggest
opportunity: whole cuts, which represent a majority of meat sales in
North America. Whole cuts come with a host of complex challenges like
texture, connective tissue, muscle fibers, and other macrostructures
that exist in animal proteins.

Whereas established production methods like high-moisture extrusion use
high temperatures that pre-cooks the food and denatures the proteins,
New School Foods' technology uses a series of cold-based processes,
yielding a product that is "raw" and transitions to cooked, keeping the
cooking experience as close as possible to ordinary salmon.

"The next frontier of meat alternatives is whole cuts, and from day one
we understood that New School Foods needed to solve two heavily
connected issues: the quality of the meat alternatives in-market, and
the limited toolkit our industry uses to produce them," said Chris
Bryson, CEO and founder of New School Foods. "What's generally available
for consumers now are rubbery, ground, pre-cooked products that will not
convince the average customer to change their lifelong habits."

New School Foods will continue focusing on research and development,
using the \$12 million raised in seed funding to expand the team of food
scientists, scale up its scaffolding technology, and build out a
research and production facility.Â 

"We invested in New School Foods because they recognized that the
existing production technologies in the plant-based meat industry are
insufficient for creating a whole-cut product that consumers genuinely
want to eat," said Nick Cooney, general partner at Lever Ventures.
"Their technology is unlike anything else we've seen in the industry in
terms of truly mimicking the texture, mouthfeel, and experience of
cooking and eating whole cuts of meat."

New School Foods is also announcing the launch of a chef-only pilot
program as they expect to launch their salmon alternative in numerous
restaurants across North America in 2023. Chefs interested in joining
can apply today at [newschoolfoods.co](http://newschoolfoods.co).
