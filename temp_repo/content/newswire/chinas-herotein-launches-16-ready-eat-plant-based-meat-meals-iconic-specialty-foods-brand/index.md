**Shanghai ---** Plant-based meat company HEROTEIN announced it has
launched a line of 16 co-branded ready-to-eat plant-based meat meals
co-created with iconic specialty foods brand Butler & White\'s. The
entire range is fully plant-based and now distributed across China,
generating fantastic reviews and high repurchase rates since its launch.
The new range draws inspiration from a variety of international
cuisines, including sausage roll and pies from British cuisine, samosas
and spring rolls from Southeast Asian cuisine, chilli con carne from
Mexican cuisine, and penne Bolognese and lasagna from Italian cuisine.

"*Product innovation is key to capturing consumer demand in the growing
plant-based meat sector, and we are delighted to partner with Butler &
White's for this new ready-to-eat range,*" said Vicky Lee, CEO of
HEROTEIN. "*We will continue to leverage HEROTEIN's unique product
innovation capabilities to be a technology and culinary leader in
bringing new plant-based meat and meal experiences to Chinese
consumers*,\" added Lee, who is former CMO of McDonald's Taiwan and
former Group Vice President at leading Chinese restaurant brand Xiabu
Xiabu.

In addition to the launch of the new ready-to-eat product range,
HEROTEIN has also established a strategic partnership with U.S.-based
Mission Barns, the global leader in cell-cultivated animal fats, to
jointly develop a line of non-GMO hybrid products made from a blend of
cultivated fats and plant based proteins for the China market. With the
partnership, HEROTEIN is well-positioned to be the first in China to
commercialize such products, which will have the health and
sustainability benefits of plant-based protein but with far more
meat-like flavor and texture.

Since entering the market in February, HEROTEIN's core lines of
plant-based chicken and beef products have launched into leading food
service outlets and online and offline retail stores, including
award-winning burger restaurants CHARLIE'S Burger, Beef & Liberty, Fat
Cow, and Grinder; premium hotels W Shanghai, Club Med, Banyan Tree; and
retailers Epermarket, City Super, Times Grocery, Just Fresh, Chun-store
and Delilife. Earlier this month, HEROTEIN\'s spicy chicken dish,
created in collaboration with restaurant King Shannon in Shanghai, won
the gold prize from the prestigious 2021 Xiang (Hunan) Cuisine Master
Chef Award Competition, a national recognition of the quality and
versatility of HEROTEIN\'s products.

HEROTEIN is the first domestic company in China to sell plant-based meat
products produced using high moisture extrusion. Founded in 2020 and
based in Shanghai, HEROTEIN has combined the formulation expertise of
R&D experts who crafted products for leading global plant-based brands
Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods with a local leadership team that has
deep expertise in the restaurant, food service and grocery sectors in
China. HEROTEIN aims to become the leading plant-based meat brand
delivering best-in-class plant-based products formulated specifically
for the Chinese market. The company was named to the [International
Future Agrifood 2020](https://vcbeat.top/Vcearth2020/index) Alternative
Protein Top 20 list, and was a winner of TechNode Global's [2020 ORIGIN
Innovation
Awards](https://technode.global/2020/11/18/origin-innovation-awards-2020-winners/)
in the Food & AgriTech category.
