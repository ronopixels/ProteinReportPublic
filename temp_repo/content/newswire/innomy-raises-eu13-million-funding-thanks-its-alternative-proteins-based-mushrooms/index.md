The Spanish startup [Innomy](http://innomylabs.com/) has raised 1,3
million euros in its Pre Series A funding round. The round was led by
international investors including Corporación Cervino, Rockstart, Zubi
Capital, Eatable Adventures and the National Center for Technology and
Food Safety (CNTA), who have taken equity stakes in the company to scale
the startup's disruptive technology and promote a much more sustainable
and healthier protein consumption alternative in other markets.

The leading Argentinian team, composed by CEO and co-founder Juan Pablo
de Giacomi, biotechnologist COO and co-founder Pablo Sánchez Rey, and
mycologist CSO and Technology Partner Francisco Kuhar, has dedicated
years of research to the properties of mushroom-based proteins and their
benefits for the health of people and the planet.

Innomy is the third Spanish food-tech startup announcing its first
funding round after successfully completing the acceleration program
Spain Foodtech developed by Eatable Adventures, in collaboration with
ICEX Spain Export and Investment and the National Center for Technology
and Food Safety (CNTA) and the Rockstart AgriFood program. Disruptive
startups Cocuus and Moa Foodtech were also selected in Spain Foodtech
program.

Juan Pablo de Giacomi, CEO and founder of Innomy states *\"We were born
as a platform to channel many years of research in the field of the
properties of edible mushrooms. Our mission is to respond to consumers
that demand good food products for their health but also for the
planet\'s wellbeing. We want to reach new markets and bring our product
to thousands of people\".*

Mycelium, a filamentous, protein-rich ingredient extracted from the root
structure of mushrooms is considered to be one of the most promising
sources of protein for the future. Its quality in terms of nutrition was
recognized by scientists a long time ago, but its current production for
human consumption is not yet widespread. Furthermore, the fact that
fungi do not produce cholesterol or significant amounts of saturated
fats has redirected the attention of the food industry towards them.

On the other hand, José Luis Cabañero, CEO and founder of Eatable
Adventures notes *\"We are very proud to be part of this new milestone
that consolidates the leadership of the Spanish foodtech ecosystem. In
the last few months, we have managed to raise Funding rounds of an
average of 1.8M for three of the startups that have been selected in our
acceleration program. We continue to bet on disruptive technologies that
impact the way food is produced and consumed, ensuring food safety for
all\".*

Mark Durno, Managing Partner AgriFood of Rockstart said: *"At Rockstart,
purpose driven and determined founders are central to our investment
selection. In the case of Innomy, the founding team is composed of
specialists in mycelium and have all shown amazing commercial insight
and humble curiosity during the mentor sessions throughout our
accelerator program. We are delighted to make our second investment in
the company."*

*\"With the entry into the capital we formalize the collaboration we
have maintained in recent years to develop Innomy\'s proprietary
technology. And now, with this financial injection, it will be possible
to bring this technology to the market and continue contributing to
transforming the future of food to make it healthier, more sustainable,
safer and available to everyone*,\" said Héctor Barbarin, CEO of CNTA.

In the context of the current global environmental and demographic
challenges, meat alternatives, such as mycelium, are an effective
solution to reduce meat production effects, which are responsible for
almost 60% of all greenhouse gasses generated by food production,
according to FAO data.

Innomy has been awarded in the fourth edition of the \'Ingenia Startup
Awards\', promoted by the Spanish Federation of Food and Beverage
Industries (FIAB), the Technology Platform Food for LifeSpain (PTF4LS)
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA). In addition,
it has been a finalist in the Foodtech Heroes 2022 in the F&A category
and has been chosen as one of the top 15 foodtech startups according to
El Referente.
