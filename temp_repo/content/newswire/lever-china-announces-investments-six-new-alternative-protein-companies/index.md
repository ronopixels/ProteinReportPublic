***Shanghai, China*** - Lever China unveiled today early stage
investments it has completed in recent months into six new alternative
protein companies, expanding its portfolio to a total of 12 startups
across plant-based meat and dairy, plant protein, precision and biomass
fermentation, and cultivated meat.

The six latest  companies that have received early backing from Lever
China are

-   **Blue Canopy**: a Hong Kong-based fermentation protein technology
    company that uses biomass fermentation and precision fermentation
    technologies to produce animal protein ingredients that can be used
    to make human and pet food
-   **Marvelous Foods**: a Shanghai-based plant-based yogurt and dairy
    products company
-   **iDAMA**: a Guangzhou- and Hong Kong-based  plant-based ice cream
    and frozen desserts company
-   **Hyplant**: a Shanghai-and Jiangsu- based soy protein ingredients
    company producing higher quality ingredients for plant-based meat
    and other foods 
-   **Good Food Technologies**: a Shenzhen- and Hong Kong- based
    plant-based pork company using a proprietary fat technology to
    produce products catered toward  Chinese culinary applications
-   **NewDay Farm**: a Jiangsu-based cultivated meat company with unique
    technology to significantly reduce ingredient and production costs 

"Lever China's first batch of portfolio companies has seen excellent
progress in  valuation, technology development,and growth in sales,"
said Lily Chen, Program Director at Lever China. "As an organization
focused on advancing the alternative protein sector, we  are excited to
be helping support the development of cutting-edge technologies in the
domestic alternative protein industry, and we will continue to support
outstanding founders and build an empowering environment for
entrepreneurs."

China's focus on food safety and environmental sustainability continues
to grow. During the two sessions of the National People\'s Congress in
March, President Xi Jinping highlighted the importance of diversifying
the country\'s sources of protein, mentioning that "we should expand
from traditional crops and livestock resources to richer biological
resources, develop biotechnology and bio-industries, and cultivate
plants, animals and microorganisms for calories and protein".  The Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), published in April 2022, also suggested increasing plant-based
protein intake and developing fermentation, cell cultivation and
plant-based technologies as an effective measure to significantly reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

Lever China invests in cutting-edge companies in the field of
alternative protein in China, helping to build an innovative, healthier,
diversified and sustainable food system. In addition to the latest six
companies, Lever China had previously completed investments in
plant-based meat companies Herotein, Haofood, and Meat Fresh; cultivated
meat companies Avant Meats and CellX, and fermentation company New
Singularity. 

Lever China's portfolio companies are popular among domestic and
international investors: Haofood recently closed a \$3.5 million seed
round with investors including Monde Nissin CEO Henry Soesanto and Rich
Products Corporation; Herotein has raised an additional \$2.5 million
from a range of local and international investors; CellX has gone on to
raise \$15m USD in additional capital from a range of investors
including Zenith Fund and Cloud Nine Capital; and Avant Meats has gone
on to secure \$15m USD in additional capital as well from leading
international AgriFood investors.
