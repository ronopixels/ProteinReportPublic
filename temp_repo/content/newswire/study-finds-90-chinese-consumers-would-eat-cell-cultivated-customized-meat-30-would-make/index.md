Market report from Lever China and Chinese media outlet FoodPlus also
finds the term \"customized meat\" resonates best with Chinese consumers

**Shanghai --** A new study of over 2,000 consumers across China finds
90% say they would eat cultivated meat, and 30% would make it their main
source of protein if it can achieve the same taste and texture as
conventional meat. The study also found that, among a variety of
different Chinese language names tested, the Chinese term for
"customized meat" (订制肉) generated the greatest consumer interest in
the category. The study, which analyzed Chinese consumers\' perceptions
of the new sector, willingness to try, long-term purchase intentions,
and demographic differences, was conducted by Lever China, a
Shanghai-based consultancy specializing in the alternative protein
sector, and Food Plus, a Shanghai-based media and research institution
focusing on entrepreneurships in the food industry.

The survey showed that the Chinese term for customized meat received the
highest evaluations in multiple dimensions, including taste, product
attractiveness, convenience, nutrition, and for being the most natural.
订制肉 ("customized meat") also had the best performance in boosting
interest in trying the product and in eating it regularly. A Chinese
term for "clean meat" also performed well, standing out in dimensions of
health, food safety and sustainability. By contrast, Chinese terms for
"cell meat" and "cell-cultivated meat" performed relatively weakly in
encouraging consumption. Previous studies have found that the English
term "cultivated meat" likely works best for English-speaking audiences.

As one of the sectors of the alternative protein field, cultivated meat
has garnered significant attention in China in recent years. With the
Chinese government's increasing emphasis on issues such as food safety
and environment sustainability, cultivated meat is becoming an important
innovation area to optimize the nation's protein resources and help the
country to achieve its carbon reduction goal. Baoguo Sun, a member of
the CPPCC (Chinese People\'s Political Consultative Conference) and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering, noted during the Thirteenth National
People\'s Congress in 2020 that "cultivated meat has become the most
popular research topic in the global meat industry, and is expected to
become the most effective method to solve meat supply problems in the
future."

The FoodPlus and Lever China study also found that if the taste and
texture of cultivated meat is the same as conventional animal meat, more
than 60% of respondents would purchase it occasionally, with another 30%
making cultivated meat the main type of meat they purchase. In total,
more than 90% of consumers would add cultivated meat to their diet
alongside traditional animal meat. Respondents aged 26-40 showed the
highest level of interest.

"We're very excited to see the huge interest in 'customized meat' by the
Chinese public," said Cecilia Zhao, alternative protein project manager
of Lever China. "Choosing an authentic Chinese name that can balance the
technology, marketing appealing, and culture familiarity is an important
step to help with the industry's development in China. The study
suggests that using the term 订制肉 ("customized meat") can help the
government and industry meet its goals in this sector by increasing
public interest and willingness to try the product, which we believe is
critical for building a national sustainable system of meat consumption
in the future."

"The cultivated meat sector has been receiving increasing attention due
to the concern of global population growth and climate change," said
Ziliang Yang, Co-Founder and CEO of leading Chinese cultivated meat
company CellX. "It\'s particularly important to better communicate with
consumers and reach consensus in the industry. Thanks Lever China and
FoodPlus for conducting the survey to help consumers understand more
about the emerging industry.\"

"The name gives consumers the first impression of the product. Whether
the naming can accurately convey what cultivated meat is and gain
consumer acceptance is very critical," said Doris Lee, general manager
of GFI Consultancy. "We hope that Lever China\'s report could stimulate
a wide-ranging discussion on the naming of cultivated meat and help the
industry to find a name that is suitable for the China market."
