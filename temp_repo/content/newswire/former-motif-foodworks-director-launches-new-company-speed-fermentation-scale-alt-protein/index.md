*Co-Founder Michael Tai, who led the development and scale-up of key
alternative protein ingredient heme as Head of Bioprocess at Motif,
launches Boston Bioworks to help startups more quickly commercialize
fermentation-based ingredients amid severe sector bottlenecks*

**Boston, MA** --- Boston Bioworks, a provider of advanced fermentation
process development and scale-up services to bio-ingredient companies,
formally announced its launch today. The company brings extensive
experience in commercial-scale fermentation to an industry that's facing
significant bottlenecks. Fermentation-based companies in the alternative
protein sector raised [\$1.7 billion in
2021](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/15/investors-salivate-over-food-tech-companies-perfecting-precision-fermentation/),
a threefold increase from 2020, with [Boston Consulting
Group](https://www.bcg.com/press/23march2021-alternative-protein-market-reach-290-billion-by-2035)
and others projecting the sector will continue to expand rapidly. As a
result of the steep increase in investment and company formation, the
sector is now facing severe supply shortages in fermentation scale-up
expertise and assets.

Boston Bioworks Co-Founder and CEO Michael Tai, Ph.D. served until
August as Head of Bioprocess at Motif FoodWorks, where he developed the
industrial production process for Motif's heme ingredient, and prior to
that worked as fermentation project leader at ADM. Tai is joined by
co-founders Mert Sahin, a cell biology Ph.D. who previously served as a
Chief Marketing Officer within Imaging at GE Healthcare, and Ted
Netland, an MIT MBA who previously worked as an analyst at Cambridge
Associates and as Director of New Ventures at Lever VC Advisers.

Tai and his co-founders launched Boston Bioworks to address key sector
bottlenecks, offering a first-of-its-kind platform for
fermentation-based companies to scale products from benchtop-scale to
commercial-scale more quickly and without expensive CapEx requirements.
This platform will enable companies producing ingredients from precision
fermentation (such as meat and dairy proteins, fats, flavorings, and
similar ingredients) or from biomass fermentation (such as mycelium) to
seamlessly bridge the gap between strain engineering and
industrial-scale production.

"We decided to launch Boston Bioworks after experiencing firsthand
severe industry bottlenecks for process development and scale-up
services, bottlenecks which are costing fermentation companies time and
leading to wasted CapEx spending," noted Tai. "We're strongly encouraged
by the enthusiastic market response we've already seen for these
services. Although we've just launched the company this month, we've
already signed four clients from several alternative protein categories
and will begin process development and pilot-scale batches for these
clients in the coming weeks. With the influx of capital into the
fermentation sector and the rapid increase in the number of startups and
products being developed, there is clearly a need for this scale-up
expertise and capacity."
