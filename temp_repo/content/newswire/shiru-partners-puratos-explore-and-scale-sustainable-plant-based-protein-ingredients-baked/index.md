***Leveraging proteins identified by Shiru's Flourish™ platform, the
partners will scale up prototype production of select ingredients for
further evaluation.***

ALAMEDA, Calif., August 31, 2022 -- [Shiru](https://www.shiru.com/), a
functional ingredients discovery company, announced today a new
partnership with [Puratos](https://www.puratos.com/), the industry
leader in innovative food ingredients for bakery, to evaluate
naturally-occurring proteins identified by Shiru's proprietary
[Flourish™](https://shiru.com/approach) platform as a promising
next-generation egg replacement.

The partnership will focus on scaling the production of prototypes for
further evaluation, leveraging Puratos' expertise in the bakery,
patisserie and chocolate ingredient industry. The project aims to
produce new functional ingredients that will unlock opportunity and
innovation in plant-based baked goods that are both sustainable and
tasty. 

"Puratos and Shiru share the vision that our food system can be a force
for good in terms of sustainability and nutrition, making us ideal
partners," said Jasmin Hume, Shiru CEO, and founder. \"Our Flourish
discovery platform has identified functional ingredients that can unlock
desirable plant-based baked goods products. We're eager to test and
scale these discoveries with Puratos, the global leader in baked goods
ingredients. By working together, we have the chance to make a major
impact towards a more sustainable food system."

Flourish, Shiru's discovery platform, uses machine learning and
bioinformatics to search through hundreds of millions of
naturally-occurring proteins to identify promising candidates that match
a specific desired food function---in this case, for use as ingredients
in baked goods. Then, using precision fermentation and high-throughput
screening techniques, Shiru produces these proteins and evaluates their
performance as ingredients. The result is a functional ingredient that
can be produced sustainably at scale whose taste and nutrition are as
good as or better than animal-based alternatives.

With Puratos, Shiru will scale production and testing for the target
functional proteins, accelerating the timeline for making these
ingredients available in baked goods for consumers. Puratos will
leverage its fermentation capability and expertise to produce prototype
quantities of the Shiru discovered proteins before conducting detailed
food application testing in a range of baked goods. 

"At Puratos, we truly believe that collaborations can fuel innovation
within the food ecosystem," stated Paul Baisier, Chief R&D Officer at
Puratos. "As a company rooted in biology and science, Shiru is the
perfect partner in the Puratos's journey to finding novel uses for
proteins discovered by Shiru's Flourish platform as functional food
ingredients that are sustainable, healthy and delicious. Together with
Shiru, we will be able to accelerate our plant-based product innovation
pipeline for the benefit of our customers and consumers."

Puratos has a strong history of innovation in the food space, and of
using technology to enable breakthroughs. In addition to the ingredient
development aspect of the partnership, Shiru is also exhibiting in
Puratos's
[Puradome](https://www.puratos.com/commitments/next-generation/mission-to-mars-programme),
a cutting-edge FoodTech Center where the harshest conditions of planet
Mars are used as extraordinary inspiration to stimulate food
innovation. 

This partnership is the latest from Shiru's innovation pipeline,
including a [recently announced
partnership](https://www.cpkelco.com/cp-kelco-and-shiru-announce-partnership-to-create-next-generation-alternative-proteins/)
with nature-based ingredient solutions company CP Kelco. In the past few
months, Shiru announced that Impossible Foods veteran [Ranjani Varadan
joined as Chief Scientific
Officer](https://shiru.com/post/in-conversation-with-dr-ranjani-varadan-shirus-new-chief-scientific-officer/),
as well as three [industry-leading
advisors](https://shiru.com/post/shiru-appoints-industry-veterans-dean-banks-aaron-kimball-and-blaine-templeman-to-advisory-board/),
including Dean Banks, former Tyson CEO.
