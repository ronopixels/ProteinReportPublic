*Israel, September 7, 2022 --* Kibbutz Yotvata and
[Brevel](https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/a2de6f3cb591d2b7889b8a054786d706c3024c3d?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrevel.co.il%2F&userId=8504106&signature=7ab89b883e5515d8) sign
a Memorandum Of Understanding agreeing to build a commercial-scale
manufacturing facility for the cultivation and production of
microalgae-based protein and related products for the food and beverage
industry. The facility will be home to the largest fermentation reactors
of their kind, sized at 30,000L, which will have the capacity to produce
900,000L per year when fully operational in order to support the rising
demand in the EU and Middle Eastern markets. Today, Brevel uses
fermenters that have the capacity of 5000L.

Kibbutz Yotvata runs Yotvata Dairy Plant in joint ownership with
Strauss, while investing in the field of food, renewable energy and
sustainability.

Brevel is providing microalgae-based alternative protein which is
affordable, flavor and color neutral, highly functional, sustainable and
at consistent and scalable production. Brevel's technology is the first
globally to combine sugar-based fermentation of microalgae with a high
concentration of light at industrial scales. The result is a protein
that will be price competitive with pea and soy and is color and flavor
neutral. Brevel's protein solves immediate challenges in plant-based
dairy and egg products that lack a valuable nutritional profile due to
the need for very mildly flavored protein sources. The unique process
enables the production of microalgae at a cost reduction of more than
90% and includes nutrient rich ingredients and functionalities that are
only produced in the presence of light. 

The Manufacturing Facility is the first of its kind to be established in
Israel and the first of multiple facilities to be constructed worldwide
with additional partners that Brevel is already in discussions with. In
full capacity, the total manufacturing volume will reach up to 900,000
liter and 3,000 tons of dry product per year. The parties expect to
export to customers abroad at least 25% of its production to various
markets. 

The Manufacturing Facility will be In the cooperation between the two
companies, Brevel is responsible to provide all required technology,
know-how and intellectual property required for the construction and
operation of the Manufacturing Facility and equipment, \[including plans
and specifications for all machinery and production line equipment,\]
and provide all required information and materials required for the
cultivation of the microalgae and the manufacturing of the product

"We are proud to build the largest facility of its kind in the world,
which will be producing Microalgae on a commercial scale to support
rising demand in various markets," Says Hannan Shushan, Yotvata\'s CEO.
"Yotvata is dedicated towards finding sustainable solutions to feed the
ever-growing world population and believes that the alternative-protein
market will play a big part in that mission. The agreement with Brevel
is a significant step in that direction".

"The agreement with Yotvata is a milestone in the world of
microalgae-based alternative protein. This first commercial scale
manufacturing facility will enable us to move our vision forward: to
become the #1 choice for plant-based protein worldwide" Says Yonatan
Golan, CEO and Co-Founder of Brevel. "We are actively working to solve
the biggest nutrition challenges that exist today. The company is
achieving this by providing truly sustainable plant-based protein which
is both color and flavor neutral, and available for the first time at an
affordable cost for the food industry'.
