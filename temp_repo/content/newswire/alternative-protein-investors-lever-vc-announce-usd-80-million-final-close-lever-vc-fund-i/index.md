**New York** --- Alternative protein venture capital fund Lever VC
announced today it has completed final close of Lever VC Fund I with USD
\$80 million raised to back early stage plant-based and cultivated meat
and dairy companies around the world. The Fund has already built a
portfolio of 19 fast-growing plant-based, cultivated and fermented
animal protein companies from across the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin
America.

Lever VC's backers include several of the world's largest meat

Europe; one of the world's largest fermentation companies, from Europe;
two of the world's largest AgriFeed companies, from China and southeast
Asia; family offices of the largest retail groups in several countries;
and a range of additional family offices.

"We're pleased with the strong growth in value, sales and technology of
our current portfolio, and we'll continue to invest in more stellar
companies over the next year," said Nick Cooney, Managing Partner of
Lever VC. "We're grateful to be partnered with some of the biggest food
companies from the US, Europe, China and Southeast Asia, as well as
value-add family offices. We also look forward to beginning the raise of
Lever VC Fund II early next year on the back of large pre-commitments
from existing LPs and strong interest from institutional investors."

Lever VC's portfolio currently consists of TurtleTree Labs (led
pre-Seed), Avant (led pre-Seed), THIS (co-led Series A), Mission Barns
(Seed and Series A), Bond Pet Foods (led Seed), Better Meat Co (Seed),

since investment, with three more set to launch first follow-on rounds
