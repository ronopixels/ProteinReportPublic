**Moolec Science is a global pioneer using molecular farming to
introduce a hybrid concept between plant-based and cell-based
technologies in the alternative proteins space.**

*Warwick, UK -- November 2020*. Moolec Science is a newly formed
Ag-Foodtech company consolidating a unique pipeline of projects and
capabilities in the Molecular Farming space, with more than one decade
under development.

*"Our mission is to improve the affordability of animal-free solutions
in favour of true sustainability. We promote a technology that will have
the cost structure of plant-based solutions with the organoleptic
properties and functionality of cell-based platforms, an approach at
least 10x more cost effective than leading alternatives"* states Gastón
Paladini, CEO & Co-Founder.

*"Molecular Farming is a technology that has not yet been fully explored
in the alternative proteins landscape. Moolec* *will promote an
inclusive and equitable technological platform as we aim to bring
farmers back into the equation"* declares Henk Hoogenkamp, CPO &
Co-Founder.

With a proof of concept for the cheese market, the team is known for
being the first to produce bovine chymosin in safflower, a functional
protein commercialized under the SPC® brand. A family of international
patents currently covers this platform, with SPC® events fully
de-regulated for cost-effective large-scale production.

*"We use plants as bioreactors",* says CTO & Co-Founder Martín Salinas.
*"Our experience and scientific background made us conclude that we
could take advantage of nature\'s biological systems to design a
resource-efficient alternative protein production platform".*

Currently, the company is consolidating different research lines to
produce unique blends of highly functional proteins from bovine and
porcine origins in protein-rich crops such as soybean and peas, creating
a new generation of meat analogues. Moolec's main and initial focus is
on food technologies, although Molecular Farming solutions can also
target industries such as health, biomaterials, and biocosmetics.

Moolec Science is company run by a diverse team with operations in the
United States, Europe, and South America. It has the support and
financial backing of various investors such as Bioceres Ventures and
Union Group.
