MODIIN, Israel, March 29, 2023 -- On Sunday evening, March 26, every
single one of the 26 women selected as the top leaders driving Israel's
foodtech revolution gathered with great enthusiasm for an energized
networking dinner in Jaffa to celebrate their accomplishments and forge
a unified community of entrepreneurs, scientists and investment experts.

A new initiative of Israel's Modern Agriculture Foundation (MAF), the
world's first known non-profit dedicated to advancing the alternative
protein industry, the celebratory event coincided with this month's
observance of International Women's Day and was designed to bring the
women, many of whom had not previously met, together as a cohesive
community.

In a Ted-style talk on "Building a female-friendly foodtech ecosystem,"
Dr. Tali Feldman Sivan, co-founder and active chairperson of Meala
FoodTech, noted a variety of metrics indicating that Israeli foodtech
companies enjoy higher female representation compared to Israeli high
tech in general, including, for example, 2.5 times the number of women
CEOs.

"There is something exceptional about Israeli foodtech," noted Feldman
Sivan, "and this is thanks to networking. But we don't do it enough and
we don't include enough people. Men do it and it works it."

"Building connections between experts with complementary knowledge and
talents is at the very heart of MAF's mission to accelerate the
alternative proteins ecosystem," said Levana Shifman, the head of MAF,
who led the initiative. "For that reason, the awards evening is just a
beginning, with many ongoing meetups, conversations and events to come."

"Knowledge sharing and networking are the key to creating impact," added
Carole Bibas-Barkan, MAF's COO, explaining the NGO's motivation for
organizing the event.

Another key to the advancement of women in the foodtech industry, is
"firgun," said Dr. Feldman Sivan, using a Hebrew term referring to
celebrating another's accomplishments.

"Firgun" was abundant at the Asian dinner party, hosted by Mika FoodArt
in her stunning Jaffa home. "What a perfect evening full of terrific
energy and firgun for the sisterhood," confirmed Keren Or Dubinsky,
founder of Instegg.

"It was an impossible task to choose," Anat Ziv, head of innovation for
Tnuva, said of her responsibilities as one of the 11 expert judges
charged with selecting the dynamic group of female foodtech superstars
out of an initial crowded pool of 50 candidates.

Addressing the participants, she added: "I'm tremendously excited about
this opportunity to honor your critical contributions. It is essential
to continue to draw more women into the field, and by building this
stellar network, we can further that goal."

"Each one of you is more impressive than the next," agreed Shifman,
addressing the diverse cohort with representation from companies, hubs
and VCs including Aleph Farms, Sea2Cell, ChickP, Innovopro, Bee-io Honey
Ltd., and Kinoko-Tech, The Kitchen Hub, Fresh Start and JVP, alongside
independent researchers and consultants.

Co-sponsored by Tnuva Ventures, the venture capital fund belonging to
Israel's largest manufacturer of food products, along with Reinhold
Cohn, Tivall, ConexionIsrael, VidiMoni and Midas Chocolate, the
recognition for the 26 women drew a great deal of notice in Israel's
broader foodtech ecosystem, with many additional women requesting to
participate in future events involving the emerging sisterhood of
outstanding foodtech figures.

The next networking meeting for this impressive group is scheduled for
late May.
