**Sustainable meat alternative from the brewery**

**Germany's leading biotech startup Mushlabs will be working together
with Bitburger Brewery Group, one of the most significant private
brewery groups in Germany. Bitburger aims to provide capacity as well as
byproducts from beer production as raw materials. Mushlabs intends to
valorize and use these local by-products to cultivate edible mushroom
mycelium in a highly efficient fermentation process. The mycelium will
be used to produce nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods. With this
unique collaboration, the two companies aim to demonstrate a possible
solution to the waste of resources and thus make a contribution to the
circular economy in Europe.**

Hamburg, July 13, 2022. Bitburger Ventures, the venture investment arm
of the Bitburger Group of Companies, invested in Mushlabs in 2019. Now
the companies are launching their strategic collaboration, with the goal
of rapidly developing innovative production processes that could save
millions of tons of CO2.

Utilizing high-value byproducts from the local agri-food industry, and
thus returning valuable nutrients to the food economy, are integral
parts of Mushlabs' strategy. The startup is one of the first biotech
companies in the world to use byproducts for the fermentation of edible
mushroom mycelium. In the future, the raw materials will be sourced
locally and the food produced on site --- in each case adapted to the
individual conditions and needs of the market. This efficient use of
resources makes fermentation one of the most sustainable methods of
producing alternative proteins worldwide. The Bitburger Brewery Group
has been working intensively on sustainability issues along the value
chain for years and already recycles its residual materials to the
agricultural sector. In cooperation with Mushlabs, these residual
materials will be used for mycelial fermentation, among other things, in
order to reduce transport distances and further improve the CO2
footprint.

**Quote from Dr. Thibault Godard, CSO at Mushlabs:**\
"Mushlab's technology is able to address the sustainability and supply
security issues plaguing our current food system. We can utilize the
full potential of natural resources by recovering the nutrients from
valuable industrial food leftovers and reinjecting them back into local
food economies. In doing so, we show that it is possible to
simultaneously increase the efficiency, profitability, and
sustainability of historical food production systems.

**Quote from Jan Niewodniczanski, Managing Director Technology and
Environment at Bitburger Brewery Group:**\
"We are always looking for ways to improve the sustainability of our
production process and to explore new, innovative paths. This has been
part of Bitburger's DNA for 200 years."

**Quote from Dr. Friedrich Droste, Managing Director of Bitburger
Ventures:**\
"Mushlabs is an excellent example of how we understand our role as
Bitburger Ventures in the group of companies --- through the interaction
between the fermentation know-how of Mushlabs and the technical brewing
know-how in the Bitburger Brewery Group, we can offer real added value.
Using by-products and existing infrastructure from the brewing process
to produce alternative proteins in the brewery environment is no longer
a future fantasy with this cooperation, but lived practice that creates
sustainable value for all parties involved and the environment."
