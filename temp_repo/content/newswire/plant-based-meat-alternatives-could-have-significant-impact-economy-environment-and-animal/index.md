alternatives from Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and other companies
could have a significant impact on the economy, environment, and animal
welfare if they replace animal-based meats and reduce livestock
production. However, much depends on the extent to which consumers are
willing to shift their diets, the structure of the meat industry, and
the inter-linkages of the livestock industry with the other parts of the
economy.

Currently, prices for plant-based meat are substantially higher than
those for animal-based meats. For example, plant-based burgers are about
65% more expensive than animal-based ones in the US.

However, prices are falling. For example, in 2021, Impossible Foods cut
the price of its burger patties [by
20%](http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=bSe1594W74wplpYONaT-2B6FNmJyTemxvuLHMn3tgz1ESRaEgTMf-2BNed1TT87P6PS2mVEJb1q1TCm7VTIMtprMWw-3D-3DXaFE_9K0UiPsDyCOyTfmOIa4lZwEbPjQWPdGnMn-2BDC77rhq8gr2IBHayEOctxVY2zwmfqbB-2FTCMHi-2FB5O7jxNx2mOMjlWjYe39WF7usj9jBbEznB2BH38sk09GCOaW-2F9Kcylw0tpzg4uFAdvblkGeAi-2F2j9tttdATOfnaOMlcFCwf1Q7KiH2m4WzsJYamDtbLH79ufsARw0meSYWPVf1wwTQxiDvKKCbXY4ws0wNM2QX00dRz4xpB6E9t3k-2FnCljCpvA7l8exg4qBN8N3Nlf33Lh2tzWPx1jLtNOz-2BsEuHKfB8iFBQPAvmAkz90m-2Bs969x-2BxtbxjtsENT4LVLmjBvnu-2BvNRe2wrXvR8MVL3GEKoHy-2BHWvVZqqdAI9s10X3O4QpOrtIy1yl8lyiRbijvc18y0ALw-3D-3D)

prices have fallen at a [similar

projects how continued declines in the price of plant-based ground beef
will affect cattle and beef production, as well as beef industry
profits, land use, and climate change. It finds that a 10% price
reduction, which could be within the next year, would have a minimal
effect on US cattle production. The authors project that while it would
reduce ground beef production by about 1.2%, it would only reduce the
number of cattle slaughtered by 0.15%. The shift in demand would also
only modestly reduce cattle and beef prices.

The decline in production and prices would put downward pressure on the
revenue and profits of cattle producers, packers, and input suppliers to
the cattle industry. Yet like the decline in prices and production, it
would be limited---an order of magnitude less than the average
year-to-year variation.

There are several reasons for this modest impact:

1.  Plant-based beef and meat consumption is currently low, accounting
    for
    [1.4%](http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=bSe1594W74wplpYONaT-2B6MFolrgiprpISFwWYpBS-2Fe8awMYHAa69ZtdYRvnwlXA-2FImri_9K0UiPsDyCOyTfmOIa4lZwEbPjQWPdGnMn-2BDC77rhq8gr2IBHayEOctxVY2zwmfqbB-2FTCMHi-2FB5O7jxNx2mOMjlWjYe39WF7usj9jBbEznB2BH38sk09GCOaW-2F9Kcylw0tpzg4uFAdvblkGeAi-2F2j9tttdATOfnaOMlcFCwf1Q7KiH2m4WzsJYamDtbLH79ufsARw0meSYWPVf1wwTQxiDvKKCbXY4ws0wNM2QX00dRa9pvC3dv-2F3cnkI3wMbk7OdhElAzpQwzcQZCuxSVwq3yCSfvndNJZ0EG0smZjBiYOo-2B9eerpYXXCQNnrs57-2Bey3-2FtZv6QccnSzL4ZMVwaJQ53bh9N1jli7azfWyfqurMTfzJ4ga180cVg0NGhLiUOvrSoforrPUhkm72RR7HHFmw-3D-3D)
    of US meat sales. Even a large percentage increase in consumption
    would still result in a relatively low market share, moderating the
    effect on animal-based meat consumption and production.
2.  Consumers only partially substitute plant-based meat for
    conventional meat, meaning that an increase in plant-based meat
    consumption doesn't proportionately reduce animal-based meat
    consumption.
3.  Plant-based beef is primarily a substitute for ground beef. When
    ground beef demand declines, cattle producers can sell more meat as
    sirloins, chucks, ribs, and other non-ground products.
4.  More than 10% of beef produced in the US is exported. When domestic
    beef demand declines, cattle producers can increase exports. 
5.  Cattle are typically raised for about 18 months, so producers can't
    quickly shift production to respond to market changes. In the long
    run, we expect plant-based beef price declines to have a modestly
    (\~12%) larger effect on the number of cattle slaughtered, but a
    smaller one on producer profits.

Due to these economic dynamics, the authors project reductions in
plant-based beef prices would also have only modest environmental
benefits.

As detailed in another recent report, "[The Case for Public Investment
in Alternative
Proteins](http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=bSe1594W74wplpYONaT-2B6FbZujzKnehUr0brmLcf5S0lj5XdUb8OWGfLA6vxqGMNFagKqhdwc03flXp8oKo2E-2FBbKjUadcpLJEWIDS0UnDpQZ4wgdZwNURxhk9jzTDXDGCRy_9K0UiPsDyCOyTfmOIa4lZwEbPjQWPdGnMn-2BDC77rhq8gr2IBHayEOctxVY2zwmfqbB-2FTCMHi-2FB5O7jxNx2mOMjlWjYe39WF7usj9jBbEznB2BH38sk09GCOaW-2F9Kcylw0tpzg4uFAdvblkGeAi-2F2j9tttdATOfnaOMlcFCwf1Q7KiH2m4WzsJYamDtbLH79ufsARw0meSYWPVf1wwTQxiDvKKCbXY4ws0wNM2QX00dSjTNvA9XAdviBIaCAqT3pz9rbnAaO9yGEKlCWQ6cYTZdC5O1dYaJyIxy3lRuIUVMaKS08WyDNY2l-2By-2FV9-2FDcqBhhNBGcfTGy0wjAX4qCworfUl65xTTr8qUNXArH0LzBwC5khpeX0Pa79s25PaCQPa5hTB1jIEkVAkqN6wc6yjAw-3D-3D),"
to capture more consumer demand in the future and to have greater
environmental benefits, the taste and texture of alternative meats must
continue to improve and new types of products, such as substitutes for
whole cuts of meat, must be developed. This will likely require
fundamental, government-funded research as well as public support for
scaling up new alternative meat technologies and more dramatically
reducing costs.

But improving the environmental sustainability of meat cannot solely
rely on alternative meat. As described in the Breakthrough Institute's
recent report, [The Clean
Cow](http://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=bSe1594W74wplpYONaT-2B6FbZujzKnehUr0brmLcf5S0lj5XdUb8OWGfLA6vxqGMNe-2BvWlYvT6VL-2FzgW-2BzKwXaQ-3D-3DpqCj_9K0UiPsDyCOyTfmOIa4lZwEbPjQWPdGnMn-2BDC77rhq8gr2IBHayEOctxVY2zwmfqbB-2FTCMHi-2FB5O7jxNx2mOMjlWjYe39WF7usj9jBbEznB2BH38sk09GCOaW-2F9Kcylw0tpzg4uFAdvblkGeAi-2F2j9tttdATOfnaOMlcFCwf1Q7KiH2m4WzsJYamDtbLH79ufsARw0meSYWPVf1wwTQxiDvKKCbXY4ws0wNM2QX00dQJTp5mBsIuLkx4kJj3TpkoNW6Y4nKO815o7zIjpgFqc6ZZaaOVdss5XGBF-2Fc-2FtBq8Qp6YFYDE7OjWKlPwetpcqqPFLWEhXF-2FnJ41-2F8hW7MMz1PH5-2BbPmrkmjORoO7Ag2VtJ2VtR-2Btx5GxaoUTJmCqarEebL7fu3i2bDDHZ57-2Fdfw-3D-3D),
development and adoption of a suite of practices and technologies, such
as methane-reducing feed additives, is also needed to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and other impacts from livestock production.
