    seed funding round**
-   **Partnership aims to support the commercialization of Bluu
    Biosciences' cell-based fish products and to facilitate access to

**Berlin, 11 May 2021.** Since its successful launch in January,
Delivery Hero-backed DX Ventures has focused on becoming a trusted
venture capital partner for innovative technology startups across a
diverse range of industries. With its investment in Bluu Biosciences as
part of the company's seed funding round, DX Ventures continues to
support efforts to create a more sustainable global food system.

Bluu Biosciences is the first company in Europe to specialize in the
development and production of cell-based fish using advanced
biotechnology. Cell-based or cultivated fish is sustainable fish meat
produced from real fish cells that is grown in a bioreactor. It is an
animal product that, unlike wild-caught fish, is obtained without
compromising animal welfare. According to the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, about 90 percent of all edible fish
stocks are already considered maximally exploited or overfished, while
demand continues to rise as the world\'s population grows (source:
[](http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/) [FAO,
2020](http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/)). More and
more people are relying on fish as their primary source of protein.
Producing cell-based fish without harming the ecosystem and at
competitive prices can make a critical contribution to global animal
protein supply security in the future, as well as bringing a range of
health benefits to consumers.

**Brendon Blacker, Partner at DX Ventures commented:** "Sustainability
is at the heart of DX Ventures' values and we are excited to support
Bluu Biosciences to create a more sustainable seafood industry. We
decided to partner with Bluu Biosciences after being impressed with the
deep expertise of their world-class team and their clear focus on
tackling the many challenges associated with the current fishing
industry. We also see tremendous potential to leverage our food industry
expertise to assist Bluu Biosciences with marketing its cell-based fish
products to restaurants and commercial kitchens worldwide."

**Dr Sebastian Rakers, founder and managing director of Bluu Biosciences
together with Simon Fabich explained:** "With this investment from DX
Ventures we have gained a long-term partner who, like us, is committed
to greater sustainability in the food sector. With DX Ventures' strong
backing from Delivery Hero SE, a DAX company in Germany, we believe
there are many long-term benefits to realize from our partnership. The
collaboration is also an incredibly interesting opportunity for future
distribution -- with the potential to access thousands of great
restaurants and kitchens internationally, which we see as an attractive
way of accelerating our commercialization roadmap."
