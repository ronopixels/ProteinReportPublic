MODIIN, Israel -- In anticipation of International Women's Day on March
8, the Modern Agriculture Foundation (MAF), an Israeli non-profit
dedicated to advancing entrepreneurship and innovation within the
alternative protein industry in Israel and globally, together with Tnuva
Ventures, Tnuva Group\'s foodtech venture capital fund, announce a new
initiative honoring Israel's leading female figures in the nation's
thriving foodtech industry.

From a broad pool of candidates including those well established in
their field along with up-and-coming industry movers and shakers
pioneering promising innovations, judges will select 12 women driving
Israel's success as a foodtech powerhouse. Tivall, a leading Israeli
manufacturer of plant-based foods, has also signed on as a sponsor of
the initiative.

"The recognition of these accomplished women embraces the fact that
there are myriad routes to meaningful impact in foodtech, including
research, development, entrepreneurship, investment, mentoring, policy,
and more, all building a strong sector with the potential to address
global challenges such as food security, climate crisis, supply chain
issues, and health," remarked Levana Shifman, who heads up the event on
behalf of MAF. "Diversity engenders creative, outside-the-box solutions
which characterize the StartUp Nation. We look forward to honoring
women's essential contributions in the exciting mosaic of Israel's
foodtech ecosystem."

According to a 2022 report by the Israel Innovation Authority, women
have comprised only one-third of Israel's high-tech workforce for the
last several years, a figure that declines at higher levels of the
seniority scale. Compared to other global tech leaders, Israel has fewer
female entrepreneurs, and their companies raise less funding. On the
other hand, positive signs include increasing enrollment of Israeli
women in relevant academic fields. Numerous leading foodtech companies
in Israel were founded by women, including Aleph Farms, Sea2Cell,
ProFuse Technology, and SavorEat.

Female-led companies comprised forty percent of MAF's first cohort of
the Better Plate alternative protein track within MassChallenge Israel's
Accelerator last year, including competition winner PoLoPo, co-founded
by Raya Liberman-Aloni and Maya SapirMir, and Fabumin, with co-founder
Adi Yehezkeli.

"For years, food companies failed to tap into the full potential of
female leadership," said MAF advisory board member Carmit Oron, CEO of
SaliCrop, an Israeli startup developing innovative solutions to crop
resiliency. "At the same time, female-led companies are at a major
disadvantage when it comes to funding."

In 2022, venture capital allocation for all-female leadership teams
amounted to less than 2 percent of the \$238.3 billion granted to
American startups, representing a drop from 2.4 percent in 2021,
according to PitchBook figures.

\"I\'m honored and proud to take part in this important initiative and
represent Tnuva, which has championed the value of gender equality and
diversity. Israel\'s foodtech ecosystem is blessed with talented women
in various roles and positions. It\'s going to be a tough mission," said
Anat Ziv, Tnuva\'s head of corporate innovation, said of her judging
responsibility. "International Women's Day isn't yet redundant. I look
forward to advancing female leadership within the industry and I hope
this undertaking will light the way and forge a path for other techs and
industries to follow."

Judges will convene in late February to select outstanding figures who
will enjoy a festive and gourmet plant-based networking dinner to mark
International Women's Day featuring TED-style lectures and pitches.

Candidates may apply on their own behalf
[here](https://www.modern-agriculture.org/open-call) until Feb. 25, and
others are also invited to use the link to nominate visionary
individuals. In addition, opportunities are available for corporations,
financial institutions, media outlets, and law firms to support the
initiative as sponsors.
