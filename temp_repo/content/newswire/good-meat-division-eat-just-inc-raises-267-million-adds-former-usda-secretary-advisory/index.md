SAN FRANCISCO \-- (September 20, 2021) \-- Eat Just, Inc., a company
that applies cutting-edge science and technology to create healthier,
more sustainable foods, announced today that its [GOOD
Meat](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox/id/gooodmeat.co) division
has secured \$97 million in new funding, adding to the initial \$170
million [publicized in
May](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210518005385/en/GOOD-Meat-a-Division-of-Eat-Just-Inc.-Secures-170-Million-to-Scale-Meat-Without-Slaughter-as-Demand-Grows).
The overall \$267 million fundraise is the largest to date in the
burgeoning cultivated meat sector, which analysts predict could become a
\$25 billion global industry by
2030[\[1\]](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox/id/AQMkADI0OTIwZmJhLTg3YWYtNDgyZi1hYjk0LTNkYTg5ODdjM2VkZgBGAAAD4N%2BDpGTxy02kIcAFOmffBgcAD%2F6D9GbGt0%2BVN76PBzBzqwAAAgEMAAAAD%2F6D9GbGt0%2BVN76PBzBzqwABwkA22gAAAA%3D%3D#_ftn1).

New and previously announced investors include UBS O'Connor, a hedge
fund manager within UBS Asset Management; Graphene Ventures; K3
Ventures; Resilience Reserve, a venture capital fund founded by
entrepreneur Rob Reid and TED curator Chris Anderson; businessman
Fernando Chico Pardo and others. GOOD Meat will use the funds to
increase capacity and accelerate research and development for
high-quality, real meat made directly from animal cells. ABG, LLC; BofA
Securities, Inc.; Guggenheim Securities and VERSO Capital advised on the
transaction.

Also today, GOOD Meat added two highly regarded food and agriculture
leaders to its ranks. Dan Glickman, who is well-recognized in the fields
of agriculture, nutrition, hunger, bipartisan politics and public
policy, will serve on its Advisory Board; and Jim Borel, former
Executive Vice President of DuPont, will join its Board of Directors.

Glickman served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from March 1995 until
January 2001; spent nearly two decades as a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives; and is actively involved with organizations that fight
domestic and global hunger and promote agricultural research in pursuit
of a safer, more sustainable food system. Borel, who during
his four-decade career at DuPont led its DuPont Pioneer, Crop Protection
and Nutrition & Health businesses, is also on Eat Just's Board of
Directors.

"I\'m proud to see our company take the next step toward building
large-scale cultivated meat production. This investment, along with the
guidance of Secretary Glickman and Jim Borel, puts us in a position to
execute our plans in multiple regions around the world," said Josh
Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just. 

"I'm delighted to join GOOD Meat's Advisory Board where I can assist the
company in its efforts to provide protein options that can ultimately
help feed a growing and hungry population worldwide, safely and
sustainably. While I will always support family farmers' work to feed
the world in the U.S. and elsewhere, this company's innovative
technologies can augment opportunities over the longer term for
consumers to expand their choices and improve their diets," said
Glickman.

The investment and additions of Glickman and Borel follow GOOD
Meat's [announcement earlier this
month](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210831005602/en) that it
plans to build the first-ever cultivated meat facility in the Middle
East and Northern Africa (MENA) region through a partnership with Doha
Venture Capital and Qatar Free Zones Authority. The QFZA and the
Ministry of Public Health have indicated their intention to grant
regulatory approval for GOOD Meat cultivated chicken very soon. 

In March, parent company Eat Just announced a \$200 million round, and
in late 2020, the company secured in Singapore the [first-in-the-world
regulatory
approval](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20201201006251%2Fen%2FEat-Just-Granted-World%25E2%2580%2599s-First-Regulatory-Approval-for-Cultured-Meat&esheet=52431244&newsitemid=20210518005385&lan=en-US&anchor=first-in-the-world+regulatory+approval&index=2&md5=1e35b6bac2adbe5e4fb82b73468a67d0) of
cultivated meat. Since then, through a partnership with [partnership

enjoyed GOOD Meat's chicken.
