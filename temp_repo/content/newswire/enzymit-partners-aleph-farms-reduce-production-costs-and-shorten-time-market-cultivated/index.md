[Enzymit](https://www.enzymit.com/), a bioproduction platform company
developing enzymatic manufacturing technology, today announced the
successful development of insulin substituents, in partnership with food
technology company [Aleph Farms](https://www.aleph-farms.com/), that can
reduce the cost and development time for producing cultivated meat at
scale.

One of the most prohibitive expenses in scaling up cultivated meat
production is developing non-animal-derived serum protein mimetics that
promote and support cell growth. Such proteins are not widely available
in the current market at the quantity, quality and cost necessary for
large-scale production. Aleph Farms turned to Enzymit to co-develop
novel insulin substituents in microorganisms that can fulfill the
function of proteins found naturally in animals and do so with greater
desired activity per molecule.

\"Developing more suitable processing aids for the production of
cultivated meat is imperative for driving economies of scale and taking
cultivated meat mainstream," said Neta Lavon, PhD, CTO of Aleph Farms.
\"This innovation, combining Enzymit's outstanding protein design and
experimental capabilities with our team's expertise in cellular
agriculture, is helping to build the foundations for our sector to
achieve cost-efficiency and long-term impact."

The success of this collaboration opens the door to additional benefits,
far beyond the cultivation of cow cells. As insulin is a highly
conserved protein across mammals and other species, it has the potential
to similarly influence the production of other cultivated meat types,
such as porcine, ovine and poultry.

"Aleph Farms has been an invaluable partner for this initiative, which
can pave the way for more cost-efficient production of cultivated meat,"
said Gideon Lapidoth, PhD, CEO of Enzymit. "With recombinant proteins
currently accounting for the overwhelming majority of cell culture
costs, creating highly stable and more active insulin substituents can
markedly reduce the cost of growth media and increase efficiency in
producing cultivated meat at scale."

Utilizing its proprietary computational design algorithms and
high-throughput testing capabilities, Enzymit was able to quickly
develop a variety of insulin substituents and experimentally assess
their functionality. All those selected were soluble proteins expressed
in *E. coli* and purified without requiring refolding, complex
purification steps, or other treatments. Further screening resulted in
several leading candidates exhibiting superior results in activity for
cell culturing and requiring minimal concentration for activation. These
new proteins, which demand notably fewer downstream purification and
maturation processes, dramatically reduce production time and costs.
