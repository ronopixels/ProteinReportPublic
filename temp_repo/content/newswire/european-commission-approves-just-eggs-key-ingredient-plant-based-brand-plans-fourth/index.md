SAN FRANCISCO \-- Eat Just, Inc., a company that applies cutting-edge
science and technology on a mission to create healthier, more
sustainable foods, announced today that the key ingredient in its
popular plant-based JUST Egg products has [received approval from the
European
Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/comitology-register/screen/documents/079416/1/consult?lang=en).
The landmark approval for mung bean protein paves the way for the launch
of JUST Egg in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.

This decision means America's fastest-growing egg brand can enter the
market in countries belonging to the European Union and the European
Free Trade Association. The allowance also ensures that Eat Just's
pioneering use of mung bean protein for plant-based egg products cannot
be leveraged by other food companies seeking to introduce similar
products for five years unless those companies obtain authorization
through the same novel food application process.

"Forward-thinking consumers in Europe have been asking for JUST Egg
since the day it launched in the U.S. Whether because of climate change,
health or a connection to animals, the demand has been significant as
has interest from retail and foodservice partners. I\'m grateful for the
recent approval, which opens the door to begin distribution across
Europe before the end of the year," said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and
CEO of Eat Just.

The Commission's action is based upon the European Food Safety
Authority's (EFSA) earlier determination that [mung bean
protein](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020005499/en/JUST-Eggs-Key-Ingredient-Receives-European-Safety-Approval-Paves-Way-for-Launch) is
safe under novel food requirements.  Mung bean protein is the first
novel legume protein to be deemed safe under the regime that has
governed all new food ingredients entering Europe since May 1997.

Eat Just successfully collaborated with analyze & realize GmbH, a
leading regulatory consulting agency specializing in natural health
products, on the novel food dossier compilation and EFSA and Commission
submissions. The company is also actively engaging with the UK's Food
Standards Agency on a regulatory path to market.

Recent studies show European consumers are hungry for plant-based
products and the egg category is one of the biggest areas of
opportunity. European retail sales of plant-based foods reached €3.6
billion in 2020 -- 28% higher than 2019 and 49% higher than 2018,
according to [Nielsen
data](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F12_123CqnRLtRqfvcGxTkv7Yp7sdvjL7K%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing&esheet=52512246&newsitemid=20211020005499&lan=en-US&anchor=Nielsen+data&index=2&md5=0976973ae040c5489529b48ddf6b5663).
A 2020 [report by ProVeg
International](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fproveg.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F09%2FPV_Consumer_Survey_Report_2020_030620.pdf&esheet=52512246&newsitemid=20211020005499&lan=en-US&anchor=report+by+ProVeg+International&index=3&md5=749ad1f62420118f2126f119b1b54c62) said
stand-alone egg alternatives like JUST Egg represent a major market
opportunity due to versatility, breadth of function and frequency of
consumption.

In the United States, the country with the most widely available
plant-based eggs, the category grew rapidly in 2021 with a 42% increase
in retail dollar sales, [according to
data](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-plant-based-food-retail-sales-hit-7-4-billion-outpacing-total-retail-sales-despite-supply-chain-interruptions-and-pandemic-restrictions-creating-widespread-volatility-in-the-food-industry-301509566.html) from
the Plant Based Foods Association, the Good Food Institute, and SPINS.
In the past three years, plant-based egg sales in the U.S. have grown
more than 1,000% and JUST Egg represents more than 99% of the market.

A [2021 pan-European
survey](https://smartproteinproject.eu/consumer-attitudes-plant-based-food-report/) by
ProVeg, in partnership with Innova Market Insights, the University of
Copenhagen and Ghent University, highlighted the strength and breadth of
demand for new plant-based products. Nearly half of respondents who
identified as flexitarians (those who sometimes but not exclusively
follow vegetarian or vegan diets) thought there were not enough
plant-based choices available to consumers.

Government programs such as the European Commission's [Farm to Fork
strategy](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Ffood%2Fhorizontal-topics%2Ffarm-fork-strategy_en&esheet=52512246&newsitemid=20211020005499&lan=en-US&anchor=Farm+to+Fork+strategy&index=4&md5=4a5976af22e88c600a5e0f7bd1a00a08) have
also advocated for a healthier and more environmentally sustainable food
system. Industry groups like the [European Alliance for Plant-Based
Foods](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplantbasedfoodalliance.eu%2F&esheet=52512246&newsitemid=20211020005499&lan=en-US&anchor=European+Alliance+for+Plant-Based+Foods&index=5&md5=3406a0acb8598feee7a31df5dc8e2dae) have
called upon the Commission, the European Parliament and member states in
the Council of the EU to enable the plant-based food sector to grow and
contribute to tackling climate change, public health and other issues.
