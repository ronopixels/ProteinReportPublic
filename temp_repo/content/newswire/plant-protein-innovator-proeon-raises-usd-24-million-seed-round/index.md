Pune, India - Committed to building a sustainable and environment
friendly food ecosystem, Pune based food ingredient start-up Proeon, has
recently raised USD 2.4 million as seed capital. The funding round, led
by entrepreneur Shaival Desai, also saw participation from Flowstate
Ventures, Peak Sustainability Venture Fund I (executed by Samir Shah on
behalf of the Fund), Waoo Partners (Pratul Shroff family office), and
other angel investors. Existing investor Sanjaya Mariwala, MD of
OmniActive Health Technologies Limited also participated in this round.
The funds will be utilized to enhance growth and set up a research lab
in the Netherlands, Europe, filing IP, scaling up production and
expanding the team.

Specialized in high quality plant protein ingredient innovation, Proeon
was founded in 2018 by Ashish Korde and Kevin Parekh to promote clean
and healthy food for "people, planet, and conscience". The company helps
solve critical formulation challenges at the ingredient level, making it
easier for food companies to make tastier and healthier plant-based
meat, dairy, and egg replacement products.

Speaking on the funding, founders **Kevin Parekh and Ashish Korde
said,** \"We are at the centre of creating next-gen plant protein
ingredients and are delighted with the trust shown by our investors. By
relentlessly focusing on innovation and partnering with large global
brands as well as startups, we are working towards creating food
products that are hassle-free to formulate, and are loved by consumers.
Our immediate focus would be expanding presence in the markets of North
America and Europe, where the shift to plant proteins is accelerating at
an unprecedented pace.\"

With the plant-based proteins sector projected to reach nearly USD 200
Bn by 2027, the founders have struck a chord in the global food industry
as food manufacturers are aiming to capture the new market being
created. Global consumers are increasingly becoming aware of the impact
of their food choices, leading them to opt more and more for plant based
diets.

**Commenting on the investment, entrepreneur Shaival Desai said**,
\"We\'re really happy to have partnered with Proeon in their journey to
innovate in the alternative proteins space. Kevin and Ashish, bring deep
industry experience and thorough technical understanding of the proteins
space and are the perfect team to cater to this industry that thrives on
innovation.\"

\"We are thrilled to invest in Proeon which is catering to a rapidly
growing market of plant-based proteins in India and globally. Proeon's
technology will have a major societal impact by solving climate change
and nutrition challenges of today. The team has demonstrated exceptional
technical and strategic capabilities, and is strongly positioned for
exponential growth,\" **added Anjani Bansal, Founder of Flowstate Angel
Investment Fund.**

\"Replacing meat with plant based alternatives is a critical part of the
planet's journey towards sustainable survival over the next few decades
. Proeon's plant-based protein will play an important role in achieving
that sustainability,\" **said Pratul Shroff**.

Currently, the company is working with brands from Europe, North
America, and Southeast Asia to build more sustainable and healthier
plant-based alternatives such as highly functional plant-based
egg-replacement products, clean-label burgers, patties, and alternative
dairy products. In collaboration with their partners and customers, they
are also aiming to save more than 170 billion liters of water and
eliminate about 150 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions by replacing
wasteful, animal-based foods with plant-based alternatives.
