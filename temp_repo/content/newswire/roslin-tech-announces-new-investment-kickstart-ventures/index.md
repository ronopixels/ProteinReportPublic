**Edinburgh, June 16, 2023** --- Edinburgh-based food tech company,
Roslin Technologies, is delighted to welcome Philippine-based [Kickstart
Ventures,](https://kickstart.ph/) through the Ayala Corporation
Technology Innovation Venture (ACTIVE) Fund, as an investor in the
Company to support its mission to become the leading provider of animal
cell lines to the global cultivated meat industry.

[Cultivated
meat](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-cultivated-meat/) is meat
grown directly from animal cells without the need to raise animals.
Roslin Technologies was spun out from the University of Edinburgh's
[Roslin Institute](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin), the place where [Dolly
the Sheep](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/about/dolly), the first mammal
cloned from an adult cell, was born in the nineties. Now, more than 25
years later, Roslin Technologies is leading the field of developing
[pluripotent animal stem
cells](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-cultivated-meat/deep-dive-cultivated-meat-cell-lines/)
which have the capacity to self-renew indefinitely and differentiate
into desired end-tissues for the cultivated meat industry such as fat
and muscle cells. Roslin Technologies is making these cells available to
cultivated meat producers globally and the Company currently has
customers in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Kickstart Ventures is a leading venture capital firm from the
Philippines, backed by [Ayala Corporation](https://ayala.com/), the
oldest and one of the largest conglomerates in the country. The firm has
a track record in investing in companies that help resolve systemic
issues in supply chains that impact the Philippines and beyond. It sees
increasing food prices, a growing global protein gap and the resulting
risks around food insecurity as a key challenge to the Philippines. The
promise of cultivated meat for shorter supply chains, reduced production
time, and comparable nutrition to conventional meat, make cultivated
meat a compelling and scalable opportunity.

The strategic investment from Kickstart Ventures strengthens the
Company's footprint in Asia. It also expands Roslin Technologies'
international shareholder base which already includes investors from the
UK, Europe, Asia and US demonstrating the global potential of Roslin
Technologies' offering.

[Ernst van
Orsouw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernst-van-orsouw-25989912/), Roslin
Technologies' CEO, says:

*"We are very excited about working with Kickstart. They are passionate
about the company and bring a great footprint in Asia that will help us
expand in that region."*

[Minette Navarrete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minettenavarrete/),
President and Co-Founder of Kickstart Ventures adds:

*\"This investment in Roslin Tech is a milestone for Kickstart and the
ACTIVE Fund. The [ACTIVE Fund'](https://kickstart.ph/investment-focus)s
investment in Roslin Tech feeds into our thesis of A World of Plenty,
which invests in the future of resource availability - particularly in
innovative technologies that reframe the scarcity and abundance of
resources.*

*This investment is meaningful for the future of food security globally,
especially in emerging markets like the Philippines. The persistent and
complex issue of food insecurity demands multiple transformative
solutions. The world\'s capacity to feed a growing population is
limited.*

*Roslin Tech offers a solution that augments this limited capacity at
scale, and with speed. Roslin Tech, with their scalable, IP-rich
approach and innovative technology, offers a compelling and commercially
attractive solution. Together, we strive to create a sustainable future
for food and alleviate hunger and food insecurity."*

[Natalie Black,](https://twitter.com/natalieblackuk) His Majesty's Trade
Commissioner for Asia Pacific said:

*"Kickstart Ventures' investment into Roslin Technologies highlights the
strengths of the UK's world-class \$1 trillion tech sector, third in the
world after the US and China. I look forward to seeing the breakthroughs
that will come from this partnership and the difference it will make in
the future of food security.*"
