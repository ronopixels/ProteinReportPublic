**Vancouver, B.C. -- December 10, 2020** -- [Eat Beyond Global

("Eat Beyond" or the "Company"), an investment issuer focused on the
global plant-based and alternative food sector, is announcing that it
has joined the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA).

The PBFA is a San Francisco-based trade association that represents over
170 leading plant-based food companies and is focused on building a
strong foundation for the plant-based foods industry to succeed and
grow. Launched in March 2016, PBFA works to expand market opportunities
for this fast-growing sector of the food industry.

"We are very excited to join the Plant Based Foods Association," said
Patrick Morris, CEO of Eat Beyond. "The association acts as a catalyst
for the industry, providing up-to-date reports and data and working
closely with investors, as well as retailers to expand opportunities for
plant-based food companies."

This May, the PBFA released a report that showed that U.S. retail sales
of plant-based foods were outpacing total food sales throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic and that animal meat sales are declining. During the
16-week period ending April 19, 2020, plant-based food sales were up 90%
when compared to the year prior. Throughout the four weeks following the
"panic buying" period, total plant-based foods sales grew at 27%, which
was 35% faster than total retail food.
