**SAN FRANCISCO, C.A., April 7, 2021** - Silicon Valley-based cellular
agriculture company Mission Barns today announced a \$24M Series A to
scale up its cultivated fat technology and build a pilot manufacturing
plant in the Bay Area.

Mission Barns is focused on cultivating animal fat---without the animal.
Its technology platform enables starting from a handful of pork,
poultry, or beef cells and feeding them a plant-based feedstock inside a
cultivator. Over a short period of time, the novel process creates real,
pure animal fat that delivers the mouthfeel and flavor of meat without
raising and slaughtering live animals, and uses a fraction of the carbon
emissions, water, and land required by conventional animal agriculture.

The first commercial application of Mission Fat is in plant-based meat.
Consumers repeatedly cite flavor, mouthfeel, and meatiness as the
leading hurdles to regularly purchasing plant-based meat products. CEO
Eitan Fischer said: "Time and again, we see that the addition of Mission
Fat to plant proteins makes alternative meat products in any number of
categories far outperform the incumbent plant-based options."

The company has developed products incorporating Mission Fat in various
categories both on its own and through collaboration with leading meat
companies and plant protein partners. Applications include: bacon,
breakfast patties, burgers, nuggets, dumplings, hot dogs, poultry
sausages, meatballs, and more.

The Series A funding will be used to scale up and commercialize its
Mission Fat technology. Global food and agriculture investors
participated in the round, including Lever VC; Gullspang Re:Food
(Oatly); Humboldt Fund (NotCo & Geltor); Green Monday Ventures (Beyond
Meat & Perfect Day); Enfini Ventures (Impossible Foods & Memphis
Meats); and a European meat company. Other investors in the round
included Blue Ledge Capital; Prithvi Ventures; and Joyance Partners.

A number of Seed investors increased their stake in the company
including Global Founders Capital (Facebook & LinkedIn); Point Nine
Capital (Delivery Hero); Better Ventures; and Cantos Ventures.

Nick Cooney, Managing Partner of Lever VC, said: \"I\'ve been sampling
plant-based meats for 20 years from a huge variety of brands globally,
and have never tasted anything as meat-like as products containing
Mission Fat. This is going to be a game-changer for the alternative meat
sector, because it\'s going to help brands around the world have a
dramatically better product almost overnight."

Mission Barns' team includes senior biotechnology experts from Genentech
& Sigma-Aldrich; culinary leaders from Michelin-starred The French
Laundry & Thomas Keller Restaurant Group; and veterans from other
cellular agriculture companies including JUST & Memphis Meats.

The company has been growing quickly and is actively looking for
passionate team members who want to be on the forefront of
revolutionizing the global food system. A large number of technical and
non-technical roles can be found on its careers
