*A future where cellular agriculture enters the mainstream for meat,\
cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and materials*

TOKYO, JAPAN -- A cellular agriculture pioneer IntegriCulture Inc. has
been organizing the "CulNet Consortium", an open innovation platform for
cellular agriculture. With 12 businesses now on board, the consortium
officially launched on April 1, 2021. The project builds platforms that
assist cellular agriculture to enter the mainstream in food, materials
and other sectors.

**Purpose of the Consortium**\
The global population is set to reach 10 billion by 2050, and
conventional methods of supplying protein are expected to be unable to
meet the demand. Although alternative protein sources like plants and
other sources have already gained wide recognition, the idea of
producing meat itself by cell culture technology is highly anticipated.
There have been multiple attempts of cellular agriculture in different
countries, but most remained only on small scales. There are still
numerous problems that need solutions such as cost, safety, and
production scale. The consortium was established to collaboratively
solve these problems through open innovation. IntegriCulture Inc.
collaborates with major companies from different sectors including
scaffold, bioreactor and medium, to build a whole cellular agriculture
supply chain.

**Participants** (as of June 17 in no particular order)

-   IntegriCulture Inc.
-   EBARA CORPORATION
-   Okura Industrial Co., Ltd.
-   San-Ei-Gen F.F.I., Inc.
-   DAI-DAN CO., LTD.
-   Chiyoda Corporation
-   Nissan Chemical Corporation
-   HOUSE FOODS GROUP INC.
-   HAMANO PRODUCTS. Co. Ltd.
-   Aquaticell
-   Two other company

**About the CulNet Consortium**

The vision of the CulNet Consortium is an open cellular agriculture
infrastructure that is accessible by everyone. Through open innovation,
we aim to develop hardware, consumables, and production and distribution
methods for the CulNet System™ by collaborating with companies in Japan
and overseas in the five fields listed below. Food applications of
cellular agriculture require regulatory compliance in their raw
ingredients. Other challenges include large-scale supply of culture
medium and scaling of the cell culture process. We will conduct multiple
joint R&D projects with each member. The IP generated from the
individual R&D project will be shared among the participating members.
The members can include such IP in their own businesses. The common
precompetitive results obtained in the consortium will be shared among
members. We plan to progressively harmonize technical standards to help
create a food system capable of delivering safe, reliable products and
simultaneously encouraging more businesses to join.

\<Fields where the consortium actively pursues open innovation\>\
The consortium is steadily pushing ahead with development and
standardization in the following areas:

-   Standardized culture media: Recipes that are fundamentally different
    from the existing media (basal media). Basal media are the raw
    material for all cultured cell products, and a different type is
    required for each kind (food, material, medical, etc.).
-   CulNet System™ hardware: Hardware that lets people use the CulNet
    System™ across a broad spectrum of uses, whether it's in mass
    production or just at home.
-   Product bioreactors: Bioreactors that are used to make things like
    the products' edible parts. We estimate that a variety of animals
    used as agricultural products will be a source for the cells.
-   Cell product processing: The process control that is needed to meet
    the products' processing and safety requirements (cell components
    and culture supernatant).
-   Cell sources: The process that is used to extract and culture cells
    from livestock and fishery resources and the systems that enable the
    whole sequence of processes to be completed right where the cell
    sources are produced---tailoring them to their intended use, source
    animal species, etc.

**Comments by the member companies**

-   Makoto Nakamura, Executive Officer and General Manager of the
    Innovation Division, DAI-DAN CO., LTD.\
    "We are going to participate in developing the foundations of the
    next-generation food systems, and contribute to solving
    social issues."
-   Yukio Nanbu, General Manager of Marketing Operations, EBARA
    CORPORATION\
    "Endorsing IntegriCulture's policy of tackling food issues by
    building an infrastructure of cellular agriculture, we have decided
    to participate in the consortium. We'll strive to contribute to the
    development and rollout of the CulNet System through all the
    fluidics and control systems technology EBARA has cultivated since
    it was founded."
-   Keiichi Hamano, President and CEO, HAMANO PRODUCTS. Co. Ltd.\
    "We've been taking on challenges toward solving a broad range of
    social issues through our manufacturing capability. In particular,
    the current food systems have many issues that need to be solved
    such as environmental footprint and health of the consumers. We
    believe solving them is key to humankind's future survival and
    development. In CulNet, IntegriCulture has developed a technology
    that'll help bring about a society characterized by sustainability
    and well-being. We'll contribute to the development of cellular
    agriculture by applying the agility and flexibility that small and
    medium-sized manufacturing companies possess. We'll also bring to
    bear our knowledge, experience, and technology regarding making
    things from scratch---assets we've cultivated through the support
    we've provided to help more than 200 startup companies."

**About the CulNet System™**

The CulNet System™ is a general-purpose large-scale cell culture
platform technology capable of producing a broad range of cell-cultured
products such as cell-cultured meat and leather. The patented technology
mimics the intercellular interactions occurring in natural animal bodies
to culture any animal cells at a large scale at low cost. The
applications of the technology beyond cell-cultured meat, include
extracts and materials for cosmetics. We have already demonstrated at a
laboratory scale automated culture of various cell types and production
of serum components. We have slashed the cost of cell culture by
eliminating the use of costly fetal bovine serum and growth factors and
replacing them with cultured serum internally produced by co-cultured
cells. Please see below for details.\
