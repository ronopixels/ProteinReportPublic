**Paris,  January 10, 2023** --- The French company Algama, creator of
microalgae-based food ingredients, closes a €13M Series A financing
round. This round marked the entry into the capital of impact
investors - Noshaq, Newtree Impact, and Beyond Impact - and significant
international groups of the food industry: Grupo Bimbo, Thai Union Group
and more. These new resources allow Algama to carry out an ambitious
industrial development plan, with the opening of a plant in Belgium, and
to position itself as a critical player in the food industry\'s
transition to using new proteins.

Raw materials have been under pressure for years - the egg market has
been particularly volatile - the food industry is gradually turning to
better environmental impact and innovative solutions. In this respect,
the alternative represented by microalgae in daily food is an ideal
resource at all levels: their production respects the environment, and
their consequent nutritional contributions in proteins, essential amino
acids, vitamins, minerals, and polyunsaturated fatty acids meet the
expectations of consumers and therefore of agribusinesses.

**Algama, the pioneer in the use of microalgae in human food**

Founded in 2013 and with operations in France, Belgium, and the United
States, Algama has become a key player in using microalgae in human
food. Thanks to unique processes for separating and formulating
microalgae, Algama can offer customized alternative solutions free of
the constraints usually associated with using microalgae. A sustainable
and ethical solution, but also highly competitive because it is less
expensive than its counterparts.

*\"Our patented seaweed processing allows us to produce high-quality,
lowcost, environmentally friendly plant ingredients. The flavors stay
true because Algama offers above all delicious products.\"* - Alvyn
Severien, cofounder and CEO of Algama

The solutions are widely proven and ready to be scaled up to position
Algama as a global leader in this cutting-edge sector. Growth objectives
were made possible by the confidence of historical shareholders, such as
Beyond Impact, investors specialized in impact - Noshaq and Newtree
Impact - and heavyweights of the food industry: Grupo Bimbo, and Thai
Union Group.

Tamalga® a range of industrial ingredients replacing eggs validated by
the market. The egg market - worth more than 200 billion euros
worldwide - is under severe pressure due to increased raw materials,
energy prices, and repeated avian flu outbreaks. As a result, prices
have sometimes been multiplied by 6 in some regions of the world and
many food industry players are facing shortages.

Algama brings together researchers, engineers, nutritionists, and chefs
on an innovation platform of 40 people. The company offers expertise
ranging from the selection of algae to the formulation of ingredients.
Moreover, Algama accompanies its customers in the largescale
industrialization of plant-based products in France and abroad by
offering a customized service. The company\'s flagship product,
Tamalga®, replaces eggs in many industrial applications, particularly in
the bakery, pastry and confectionery industries (buns, cookies,
puddings, madeleines, waffles, etc.).

*\"Algama\'s ingredients and products are totally disruptive: they
actively participate in the reduction of the climate footprint of the
food chain by replacing animal proteins with plant proteins, and they
revolutionize the food industry at the taste, nutritional and functional
levels. And exceptionally in this emerging sector, they are very
competitive in terms of price, which promises them a very bright
future.\"* - Benoît de Bruyn, Founder and CEO of Newtree Impact

The potential is enormous; massive players in the baking market are
using new plantbased or egg-substitute lines in their products that have
already hit the shelves. New uses for texturizing and nutritionally
enhancing products, such as meat or fish analogues, are also emerging.

**Opening of the first plant to meet the demand for biobased
ingredients**

Holder of 25 patents in 31 countries, Algama is now ready to move up a
gear by expanding its innovative solutions within an ambitious
industrial plan to meet the strong market demand.

*\"By scaling up to a larger industrial scale, Algama can have a strong
impact in the face of the global emergency and change the food industry
system by democratizing algae in our daily diet.\"* - Alvyn Severien

To meet this demand while remaining close to its strategic partners,
Algama has chosen to set up its first factory on a 10,000 m2 industrial
site located in Liege, Belgium.
