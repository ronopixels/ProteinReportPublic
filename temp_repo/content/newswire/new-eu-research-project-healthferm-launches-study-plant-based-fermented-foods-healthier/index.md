*New research is underway: an interdisciplinary consortium of 22
international partners, with the help of community science, targets the
societal and industrial transition toward sustainable plant-based
fermented foods by design for a healthy everyday diet.*

Leuven, 1st September 2022 -- Fermented foods are consumed in Europe and
across the globe. Especially in the past decades, fermented foods have
been hailed for their nutritional and perceived health benefits. Yet
little is known about the impact of fermentation on human health or how
fermentation can be leveraged to enhance the use of sustainable
plant-based raw materials. The new EU research project HealthFerm, a
collaboration of 22 partners from across Europe, will shed light on this
forward-looking topic. Funded through the European Union's Horizon
Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and the Swiss
State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), the
project has a budget of EUR 13.1 million (11.3 and 1.8 from EU and SERI,
respectively) over the next four years. HealthFerm is coordinated by KU
Leuven, Belgium, and the consortium kicks off its activities today.

Fermented foods are 'foods made through desired microbial growth and
enzymatic conversions of food components'[\[1\]](#_ftn1). Humans have
consumed different types of these foods for thousands of years. First,
fermentation processes occurred spontaneously rather than intentionally,
and the main benefit was the increased shelf-life of foods. In the 19th
century, people started to understand the actual fermentation processes
better. It was not until the early 20th century that fermented foods
gained a reputation for being beneficial to health. At present, they are
more popular than ever due to their perceived healthiness.

Interestingly, little concrete evidence exists for their actual health
benefits. There are few dedicated studies describing the mechanisms
behind any impact of fermented foods on human health, and in-depth
knowledge of how fermentation microorganisms and fermented foods
interact with the human gut microbiome is missing. Only with the
availability of such knowledge will it be possible to design fermented
foods with optimal health benefits rather than relying on spontaneous
fermentation processes. At the same time, there is a global trend toward
a more sustainable food system by reducing the consumption of
animal-based foods. Unfortunately, using plant-based ingredients in many
meat and dairy analogue products remains challenging due to, e.g.
flavour or processing issues. In Healthferm, new plant-based
fermentations will be designed to improve the palatability of
plant-based ingredients and leverage their use in a range of foods. 

These areas are where HealthFerm will leave its mark: The project has
been established to understand better the interaction between food
fermentation microbiomes, fermented grain-based foods and the human gut
microbiome and how they support human health. At the same time,
HealthFerm will use these newly gained insights alongside microbial
resources and fermentation technology to develop novel, healthy and
nutritious foods based on legumes (pea and faba bean) and cereals (wheat
and oat), with particular attention to the inclusion of side stream
stemming from the processing of these grains. Consumer attitudes towards
fermented foods will be studied throughout Europe.

"The research undertaken in HealthFerm will potentially have a
wide-reaching impact on not only individual, societal and planetary
health, but also the wider EU food industry through greater resource
efficiency and increased use of plant-based raw materials," explains
Prof. Christophe Courtin, Professor of Food Biochemistry at KU Leuven
and Coordinator of the project.

At the heart of HealthFerm lies a community-science approach for
developing innovative plant-based food fermentations. Citizens, artisans
and companies will collect food fermentation microbiomes in Europe and
worldwide to be analysed to map the biodiversity of microorganisms used
to ferment different foods. HealthFerm will build on this knowledge to
devise novel foodstuffs that improve the sensorial and health benefits
of both traditional foods, like (sourdough) bread, as well as
sustainable plant-based dairy and meat alternatives. A specially
developed online interface will support this effort.

Prof. Courtin adds: "Of particular interest to us is also how dietary
changes including fermented foods can reduce inflammation and the risk
for chronic diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and
cardiometabolic diseases. This we would like to understand better based
on human intervention studies and will do so in comparison to a standard
plant-based diet. Alongside, we will also optimise fermentation
processes and investigate further the consumer perceptions towards
fermented and plant-based foods in Europe."

The HealthFerm consortium responsible for this innovative endeavour
comprises academic, clinical and industrial partner institutions from
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Sweden and
The Netherlands. Two Swiss partners complete the consortium. The project
officially kicks off its activities with the first meeting in Leuven,
Belgium, on September 1 and 2, 2022.
