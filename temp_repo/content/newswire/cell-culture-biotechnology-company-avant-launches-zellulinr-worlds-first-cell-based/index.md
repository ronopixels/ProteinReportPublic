Avant's first commercialized product answers the call for a sustainable
cosmeceutical option and taps into the US\$52.5 billion anti-aging
products market

**HONG KONG -** Avant announces today the launch of Zellulin®, an
ethically and sustainably sourced bioactive ingredient produced in a
fully traceable and controlled environment, using Avant\'s cell culture
biotechnology. Zellulin® is the world's first cell-based functional
protein for the cosmeceutical functional ingredient market.

Zellulin® contains multi-functional marine protein peptides that promote
anti-oxidation, regeneration, and repairing of skin more effectively
than collagen alone as per quantitative studies. It can be incorporated
into formulas of moisturizers, drinks, and supplements. Avant has
entered into material transfer agreements with a number of leading
ingredient companies. 

**Carrie Chan, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Avant** said,
"We are excited to launch our first commercialized product, Zellulin®.
This pioneering bioactive ingredient answers the quest of the market for
sustainable and innovative alternatives.  We welcome partnership with
cosmeceutical companies to develop new, ethical and sustainable products
with us."

**Dr. Mario Chin, Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Avant**
added, "Zellulin®  accentuates the commercial applications of our cell
cultivation technology platform. Avant's fully traceable offerings
revolutionize the market with powerful, pure and sustainable ingredients
for us and our planet."

technology, Zellulin® brings cell culture technology into the US\$52.5
billion global anti-aging product market with expectations to reach
US\$83.2 billion by 2027\[1\]. For more information regarding the
