ZURICH, 06.09.2022. **Cultivated Biosciences, an innovative ingredient
company founded by Swiss entrepreneurs Tomas Turner and Dimitri Zogg,
has just raised a \$1.5M pre-seed round. The funding will enable the
growing team to further optimise its production processes, research food
applications and start product development with their first clients.**

The company's financing round was led by leading Swiss venture fund
Wingman Ventures and involved other leading foodtech venture capital
investors such as Big Idea Ventures, Blue Horizon, Proveg International
and the FoodHack syndicate. The round is also supported by other
founders in the alternative protein space such as the CEO & Co-Founder
of US-based foodtech forerunner EVERY Company, Arturo Elizondo and Lukas
Böni, Co-Founder of Planted who are both acting as advisors to the
company.

\"Fats are the next frontier in accelerating the world\'s transition to
an animal-free food system, and I\'m thrilled to be personally backing
Cultivated Biosciences and their approach\", said Arturo Elizondo, CEO &
Co-Founder of EVERY.

From their laboratories in Zurich, Cultivated Biosciences are developing
a creamy ingredient from GMO-free yeast which offers the mouthfeel
needed to make plant-based dairy an alternative for average consumers.
The ingredient is clean label and has a sustainable production process.
This way, Cultivated ensures that in the future all consumers will be
able to enjoy a delicious creamy experience in a kind, sustainable and
affordable way.

"We are beyond excited to build a solution that will elevate the
mouthfeel of the plant-based dairy category and ensure that it's simply
better and cheaper than its factory farmed equivalent," adds Tomas
Turner, CEO & Co-Founder. In 2023 the company will start testing its
creamy ingredient with selected clients for high-value savoury
applications and is open to working with partners, especially from the
Swiss gastronomy sector and the European and US foodtech ecosystem.

**About Cultivated Biosciences SA**

Cultivated is a food and biotech startup solving the problem of texture
in plant-based dairy. It is developing an ingredient from GMO-free
yeast, which offers the creaminess needed for plant-based dairy to
appeal to flexitarian consumers. This ingredient has the same texture
and color as dairy products, low lipid oxidation and natural
emulsification properties. The team has been backed by leading investors
in the field and won several grants and awards in Switzerland and
Europe. Featured in several reports from the Good Food Industry,
Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute and articles from food magazines, the
solution has driven huge excitement from food producers.
