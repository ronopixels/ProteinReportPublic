**New York** --- Global alternative protein venture capital fund Lever
VC announced today the recent completion of a \$46 million fourth close
of its Lever VC Fund I. The Fund's third and fourth close included the
addition of three corporate strategic investors from Europe and
Asia---including one of the world's largest Agri-Food companies, with
annual revenue over \$50 billion USD---as well as capital from NFL and
NBA athletes, British nobility, and a global range of family offices.

Lever VC, which invests in early stage plant-based and cell-cultivated
meat and dairy companies, has built a portfolio of fourteen fast-growing
alternative protein startups across the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin
America. Over the first seven quarters of capital deployment (July 2019
through March 2021), the Lever VC Fund's portfolio has grown in value
2.33x based on valuation or valuation cap at most recent funding round.
The Fund remains open to new investors and plans to hold its final close
in June.

"We are pleased to have welcomed a variety of great, value-add corporate
strategic and family office investors into the Lever VC Fund," said
Lever VC Managing Partner Nick Cooney. "The Fund's third and fourth
closes included capital from NBA and NFL athletes, British nobility,
alternative protein industry veterans, and leading European and Asian
food corporates that will bring tremendous reach to our portfolio
companies."

Lever VC has made lead investments into high-tech companies including
TurtleTree Labs (the world's top cultivated dairy company), Mission
Barns (the world's top cultivated animal fat company), Avant (the top
cultivated meat company in the greater China region), Bond Pet Foods
(the world leader in producing meat protein from fermentation) and Mozza
(a technology leader in producing animal protein in plants), as well as
investments into Bluu (Europe's cultivated seafood leader) and Better
Meat Co (the world's leader in hybrid meat/alternative protein
products). Lever VC has also led or participated in early stage
investment rounds for fast-growing plant-based food brands Good Planet
Foods (plant-based cheese), A Dozen Cousins (ready-to-eat plant-based
meals) and Blackbird Foods (wheat protein and plant-based pizzas) in the
U.S.; Grounded (plant-based dairy protein drinks) in the UK; The Good
Spoon (plant-based mayo and condiments) in France; Marvelous Foods
(plant-based dairy) in China; and The New (plant-based meat) in Brazil.

Lever VC tracks over 1,600 alternative protein companies globally, with
team members on the ground in the U.S., U.K., France, Netherlands,
Israel, India, Singapore, Hong Kong and mainland China. The Fund's
partners had previously invested in leading alternative protein
companies including Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, JUST, Memphis Meats,
Mosa Meats, Aleph Farms and others. The Lever VC Fund will continue to
invest in early stage alternative protein companies, and remains open to
additional investors until concluding its final close.
