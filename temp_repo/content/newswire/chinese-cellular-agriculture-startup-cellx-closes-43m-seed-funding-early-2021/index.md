Led by ZhenFund, a close partner of [Sequoia
Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital) China, Chinese
cellular agriculture startup CellX just closed its second funding round
of \$4.3 million. The fundraising came half a year after the
Shanghai-based cultivated meat startup's initial pre-seed round in late
2020. Other investors participating include Sky9 capital, K2VC, Lever
VC, Better Bite Ventures, and others.

CellX aspires to bring cultivated meat products to consumers in China
and around the world. With over half of global pork supply consumed in
China, and as Chinese government commit to cut carbon agressively in the
next few decades, cultivated meat is considered a solution for China's
pork crisis and food security issue. It can significantly contribute to
low carbon transition of the country in the long term as well as the
nascent industry get to scale.

The company's 25 scientists and impact entrepreneurs works out of its
headquarter in Shanghai Zhangjiang, a leading biotech hub in China. The
company has developed multiple prototypes, including structured products
with scaffolding and 3D bioprinting technologies.

CellX is led by four cofounders with diverse backgrounds across the
field of business and scientific research. CEO Ziliang is a former
consultant from Boston Consulting Group with experience advising top
executives from Fortune 500 companies. Scientific lead Dr. Ning Xiang
was a postdoc fellow in David Kaplan\'s lab at Tufts University,
researching tissue engineering for cultivated meat. She received her PhD
from Purdue University and has more than ten years of experience in food
science. Dr. Binlu Huang is also a scientific lead who received her
Ph.D. from Tsinghua University and was a postdoc fellow at the
University of Basel and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before joining
CellX, Dr. Huang worked in the CAR-T industry in China. Cofounder Ran
Liu received his MBA from Stanford University and is a serial
entrepreneur in deep tech.

As the only team from China, CellX was selected as a semifinalist in
XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion Competition. The \$15 million competition,
launched in December 2020, is aimed at reinventing how humanity will
feed future generations.

**Cultivated Meat in China**

In May 2020, during China's annual Two Sessions, cultivated meat was
discussed as a major solution to make China's food supply more
sustainable and crisis-resilient. Cellular agriculture is well
positioned to help China solve its food security issues and achieve
carbon neutrality.

China is the world\'s largest meat market. Worldwide meat consumption is
projected to grow by 88% from 2010 to 2050
([WRI](https://www.wri.org/insights/how-sustainably-feed-10-billion-people-2050-21-charts)).
As wealth accumulates, the demand for animal protein in China increased
from 2000 to 2019 by 32% per capita. More than 50% of global pork is
consumed by the Chinese, and with insufficient and volatile domestic
supply,  6.4 billion dollars worth of imported pork was sold in 2019 in
China
 ([USDA](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market)).
The demand for animal protein in China is bound to increase with the
addition of around 120 million middle class households in the next
decade
([USDA](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market)),
but domestic resources in animal feed, arable land and freshwater supply
cannot suffice such demand. Cultivated meat provides a promising
solution to reduce the need for animal protein from factory farming, and
a stable supply of high quality protein from local sources can relieve
China\'s reliance on meat importation.

Although China has been the world\'s largest meat market, cellular
agriculture in the country  is still an emerging field. Given food
security concerns, complexity in the regulatory approval process,
 better access to local consumer tastes and dietary patterns, Chinese
cultivated meat companies are considered to have advantages over its
global peers in the local market. As of today, CellX is one of the only
three cultivated meat companies in China. As a pioneer in the field,
CellX is rapidly expanding and hiring top-notch scientists and form
partnership with institutions globally.
