**SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG -** Avant, the first cultivated meat company
in China and the first cultivated fish company in Asia, announced today
it is establishing new Research & Development ("R&D") and pilot
manufacturing facilities plan in Singapore, with the support of the
Singapore Economic Development Board ("EDB"). The new facilities will be
supplemented by existing operations in Greater China. Avant will recruit
local talents as part of its expansion.

**Carrie Chan, Co-founder and CEO, Avant** notes, "Avant has grown its
presence in strategic locations in Asia to optimize its market access,
technology ecosystem, and funding opportunities. Singapore provides
Avant with regulatory clarity, international talents, and sufficient
space for the next step of scaling up."

\"Avant is an example of an alternative protein company which has tapped
into the eco-system opportunities in Singapore to bring innovative
products to market and capture growth opportunities in Asia." said
**Damian Chan, Executive Vice President, Singapore EDB**.  "We welcome
their expansion here and will continue to work with companies to
leverage Singapore to enable innovations in sustainable Agri-Food
technologies." 

Asia Pacific dominates the global fish and seafood markets at US\$60.5
billion in 2018 and Asia is projected to account for 71% of the
additional fish consumed by 2028. The expansion represents an important
milestone of Avant's pan-Asia strategy. 

Singapore's '30 by 30' national food security policy targets to produce
30% of the nation's nutritional needs locally by 2030, with less than 1%
of land designated for agriculture. Singapore is the only country with a
regulatory precedent for approving the sale of cell-cultured meats.

**About Avant **

the first cultivated meat company in China and the first cultivated fish
company in Asia. The company offers an end-to-end technology platform,
including cell line, culture medium, scaffolding, and bioprocess
development, to produce fish proteins directly from fish cells. Avant
aims to be a global leader in producing traceable and sustainably
