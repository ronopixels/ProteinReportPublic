**Berlin, March 26th, 2021.** Berlin-based biotech startup Bluu
Biosciences has closed its seed funding round at 7 million euros less
than ten months after its foundation. Bluu Biosciences is the first
company in Europe to specialize in the development and production of
cell-based fish. There is currently only a hand full of other companies
active in this field worldwide. Leading global food and impact investors
such as Manta Ray Ventures (UK), CPT Capital (UK), Lever VC (USA),
Norrsken (SE) and Be8 (GER) participated in the investment round. The
fresh capital will flow into the company\'s intensive biotechnology
research and development work as well as into product development. The
founding of Bluu Biosciences was supported by the Berlin-based company
builder EVIG, which specializes in working with scientists to build
biotechnology start-ups in the food sector.

"We are proud that we could partner with investors such as Manta Ray,
CPT, Lever, and more, that believe in the importance of deep innovation
for the aim of a more sustainable food system," explained Dr Sebastian
Rakers, co-founder and managing director of Bluu Biosciences. "The round
was closed in a matter of weeks, which indicates how compelling the
science team and the science foundation of Bluu is. It also showcases
the incredible interest of great investors to support this kind of
initiative," Simon Fabich, Co-Founder and managing director, added. The
Cultivated Meat sector, where there are already initial approvals for
cultivated meat products in Singapore, is fuelling the prospects for a
similarly positive development in cell-based fish products.

**Cultivated Fish -- sustainable protein source for future supply
security**

Cell-based or cultivated fish is sustainable fish meat produced from
fish cells that is grown in a bioreactor. It is an animal product that,
unlike wild-caught fish, is obtained without compromising animal
welfare. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, about 90 percent of all edible fish stocks are already
considered maximally exploited or overfished, while demand continues to
rise as the world\'s population grows (source: [FAO,
2020](http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/)). More and
more people are relying on fish as their primary source of protein.
Producing cell-based fish without harming the ecosystem and at
competitive prices can make a critical contribution to global animal
protein supply security in the future. \"Cultivated fish has the
potential to feed a large portion of humanity. Our task is to rapidly
operationalize the findings from biotechnological research to leverage
this potential," emphasized Sebastian Rakers.

Other advantages of cultivated fish include its high nutritional value,
the absence of pollutants, its availability even in places without
access to the sea and the associated short supply chains. The production
process is resource-friendly and has a significantly lower CO2 footprint
as well as water and energy consumption compared to the conventional
fish processing industry. Moreover, cell-based fish is the answer to
industrial fish farming, as it will be able to save trillions of fish
lives.

**Research & Development at the highest level**

"Bluu Biosciences has set out to produce tasty and nutrient-optimized
fish products from fish cells that are free of genetic engineering,
antibiotics and environmental toxins,\" said Rakers. "Above all, that
means intensive research and development work to develop the optimal
fish cell lines for subsequent production. Bluu is in the excellent
position of using proprietary technologies and non-gmo immortalized cell
lines to achieve that." Bluu Biosciences cooperates closely with the
Fraunhofer Research Institution for Marine Biotechnology and Cell
Engineering (EMB) in Lübeck in this endeavour and has a state-of-the-art
R&D environment at its disposal. Further partnerships for nutrient media
optimization and bioreactor development are planned.

**About Bluu GmbH (Bluu Biosciences)**

Biotech company Bluu Biosciences is the first company in Europe to
specialize in the development and commercial production of cell-based
fish. As a pioneer at the interface of biotechnology and food
technology, Bluu Biosciences is stepping up to produce high-quality,
sustainable fish products from cell cultures, that feature high
nutritional value and a premium flavour profile. The aim is to produce
fish sustainably and cost-efficiently, thus making a significant
contribution to securing the future supply of animal protein for
mankind. The biotech, based in Berlin and Lübeck, was founded in 2020 by
Dr Sebastian Rakers and Simon Fabich with an expert team of marine
biologists, cell biologists, cell and tissue engineers, and food
technologists. In R&D, Bluu Biosciences closely cooperates with the
Fraunhofer Research Institution for Marine Biotechnology and Cell
Engineering (EMB) in Lübeck and has a state-of-the-art R&D environment.
