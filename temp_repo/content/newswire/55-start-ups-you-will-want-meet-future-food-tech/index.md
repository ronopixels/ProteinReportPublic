Food-tech start-ups are trailblazing the future of food. As talented
innovators leverage new technologies to bring novel foods to consumers
on a global scale, there has never been a more exciting time to touch,
taste and smell the breakthrough novel foods.

[Future Food-Tech](https://futurefoodtechsf.com/) reveals 55 start-ups
for your innovation radar, as they take the global summit spotlight in
San Francisco on March 24-25.

*"The wait is almost over! 55 food-tech innovators will vie for
attention through innovation challenges, start-up pitches, product
launches and tastings. This summit will bring you closer than ever to
the future of food,"* says **Jet** **Luckhurst**, *Start-Up Partnerships
Manager* at **Future Food-Tech.**

***Entrepreneurs at the cutting edge of innovation present solutions
including: precision fermentation, plant-based whole cuts, functional
protein ingredients, food waste and cultured meat scaffolding:***

**Innovation Challenge Finalists**

    yeast, which offers the creaminess needed for plant-based dairy
-   **The Melt** makes a compelling product for the flexitarian market,
    the saturated-fat conscious and lactose intolerant using the
    existing dairy food production system

**Gone in 60 Seconds Presenters**

Six early-stage innovators reveal their technology's potential in just
60 seconds, with four favorites, voted by the audience, presenting later
the same day at the summit:

-   **Done Properly** develops bioprocessed ingredients through
    fermentation technology
-   **Libre Foods** bridges the gap between plants and animals through
    fermentation to replicate the taste and texture of animal products
-   **Liven Proteins** offers animal-free, functional protein
    ingredients through precision fermentation to enhance the sensory
    qualities of alternative proteins
-   **Maya Milk** produces animal-free dairy proteins and fats through
    precision fermentation
-   **No Palm Ingredients** ferments any waste stream that contains
    sugar, fatty acids or alcohol into an oil that has similar
    characteristics to palm oil
-   **Tender Food** develops whole muscle cuts with the goal of enabling
    replacement of 90% of the meat types that our society currently
    consumes by 2030

**TechHub Exhibition**

At the TechHub Exhibition, powered by ICL Planet, the founders of 10
early-stage companies will demonstrate their technology and be ready to
meet with summit delegates:

-   **Alfred's Food-Tech** uses Protein Layering and Nutrient Embedding
    Technology (PLANET) to create 100% plant-based whole cuts
-   **Demolish** recreates and replaces whole-cuts of meats, starting
    with fish, using plant-based ingredients
-   **Change Foods** creates animal-free dairy foods by leveraging
    precision fermentation technology, starting with cheese
-   **ClearCogs** helps restaurants to reduce food waste and stockouts
    through predictive forecasting
-   **Defined Bioscience** brings fully defined, animal-free,
    high-functioning and scalable ingredients to the cultured meat
    industry
-   **MyAir** offers a solution for stress management through
    personalized nutrition
-   **Nfinite Nanotechnolgy** develops smart nanocoatings for
    sustainable packaging

    enables it to produce first-of-a-kind sunny side up and poached eggs
    from plants

**Step-Up to the Plate**

Innovators at the forefront of chicken alternatives and ingredient
innovation share their insights in a 'kitchen-to-fruition' Q&A. Chefs
will create dishes with novel foods on stage using **Meati** **Foods**'
mycelium whole cuts, **Sundial** **Foods**' plant-based chicken wings,
**Umiami**'s plant-based whole cuts, **MeliBio**'s alternative honey,
**QOA**'s alternative chocolate and **Evo Foods**' plant-based eggs.

Critics will then give their verdict on the culinary delights live on
stage.

**Taste Lab**

Making its debut at Future Food-Tech, the Taste Lab is where small
groups of delegates will be able to attend product launches and tastings
of some of the most talked-about novel foods.

Food-tech founders from Australia to Israel and Italy to USA will each
host a Taste Lab serving: Microbial fermented milk (**Remilk**);
Poppable nutrient-dense snacks (**Incredible** **Foods**); Plant-based
chicken nuggets and sausage rolls (**v2food**); Cocoa-free chocolate and
peanut-free butter cups (**Voyage** **Foods**); Plant-based salmon
(**Plantish**); Microbial fermented protein milk (**Superbrewed Food**);
and gene-edited lettuce (**Pairwise**). **Thimus** will also present its
new hardware and software platform for quick evaluation of human
response to food experiences.

**On the Main Stage**

Innovators are a critical part of the food-tech conversation, and the
summit spotlights industry talent as entrepreneurs share their
perspectives alongside food brands, investors and technology companies:
