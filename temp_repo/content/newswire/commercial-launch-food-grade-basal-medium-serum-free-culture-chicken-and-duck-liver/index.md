**Inexpensive food-grade serum-free basal medium**

IntegriCulture Inc. performed the first successful cultivation of
chicken and duck liver-derived cells in a serum-free basal medium by the
CulNet system, which emulates natural inter-organ interactions.\*1 We
have successfully replaced all research-grade materials with food
materials to achieve functional equivalence at a reduced cost. We became
the first to implement a cell culture by serum-free basal medium that
other cell-cultured meat producers around the world are also working on.
The cost of cultivation using IntegriCulture's basal medium (product
name: I-MEM) and CulNet system has been estimated to be about 1/60 of
media using animal serum. We are aiming to launch cell-cultured foie
gras this year as our first line of cell-cultured meat products.

**Animal serum is essential for traditional culture methods**

Conventionally, basal medium supplemented with 5-20% animal serum is
used to cultivate animal cells. Serum contains growth factors, albumin,
and hundreds of other proteins, and these components are essential for
cell proliferation. Without serum, the cells would be undernourished and
unable to survive for a long time, let alone proliferate. However,
animal serum is expensive and has ethical issues, so there is a
worldwide competition to develop an alternative. It is said to cost
US\$3,000 (about 320,000 yen) to produce a 1 pound (about 450 g) chicken
nugget using traditional serum-added media.\*2

**Production of serum components made possible by the CulNet™**

The "CulNet system" developed by IntegriCulture uses inter-organ
interactions to produce serum components and use them for cell
cultivation. The system consists of a bioreactor for cultivating
multiple "feeder cells" (feeder bioreactor) and a bioreactor for
cultivating cells that will become the product (product bioreactor)
(Figure 1).

Feeder cells are the cells that secrete suitable serum components for
the cells in the product bioreactor. Multiple feeder bioreactors, each
containing one type of organ cell, are connected together. All
bioreactors are filled with basal medium containing basic nutrients such
as sugars and amino acids, that circulates throughout. The main feature
of the CulNet system is that the feeder bioreactor continuously supplies
the serum components required for the target cell culture. Feeder cells
"cultivate" each other, while producing the serum to proliferate cells
in the product bioreactor. In our in-house evaluation, just changing the
basal medium regularly in the CulNet system maintained mutual cell
cultivation for over 130 days. The serum-like components secreted by the
feeder cells include albumin, transferrin, and others according to our
analysis. Another feature of the CulNet system is that the combination
of organ cells in the feeder bioreactor changes the type of cells that
can be proliferated in the product bioreactor. Through numerous
screening experiments, IntegriCulture has discovered the optimal
combination of organ cells to facilitate the efficient proliferation of
chicken and duck liver-derived cells (patent pending).

**The CulNet™ facilitates faster cell proliferation than using
animal serum**

We found that using CulNet's serum-free medium produced by a certain
combination of feeder cells led to faster proliferation of liver-derived
cells than conventional medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum)
(Figures 2 and 3). The cell doubling was 1.5 --- 2.5 times faster, and
thus concluded that the CulNet system can replace animal serum in
proliferation of liver-derived cells. We expect increased commercial
production efficiency and significantly reduced costs (Figure 3).

**CulNet PIPELINE --- contract research and development project**

IntegriCulture is the first to implement cell culture by serum-free
basal medium that cell-cultured meat producers around the world are
working on. There is a wide range of potential industrial applications
in cell cultivation such as cosmetics, leather, pharmaceuticals, and
others. The applicability of CulNet system extends beyond poultry,
including mammals, fish, crustaceans, insects, and so on. IntegriCulture
aims to build a cellular agriculture platform encompassing
hardware,media, materials, products and markets. We stay committed to
our corporate mission of building a universally accessible cellular
agriculture infrastructure by building a cellular agriculture
value chain.
