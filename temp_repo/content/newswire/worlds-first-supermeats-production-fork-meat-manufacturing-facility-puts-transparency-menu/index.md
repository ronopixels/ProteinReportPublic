***SuperMeat showcases production-to-fork meat manufacturing model for
the first time, enabling transparency for meat consumers***

**Tel Aviv, Israel (March 18, 2021)** Food tech company
[SuperMeat](https://supermeat.com/) has launched the world's first
production-to-fork cultured meat manufacturing facility. The facility
was introduced at a live event at the [Future
Food-Tech](https://futurefoodtechsf.com/) conference, where the cultured
meat manufacturing process was demonstrated from chicken cell to chicken
burger for the first time. During the event, the company announced that
they have cut down their production cost by 50%, bringing a 100%
cultured meat burger down to \$30.

The venue provides meat consumers an unprecedented opportunity to
observe the meat manufacturing process while dining on a menu based on
cultured chicken. The indoor production-to-fork facility can produce
hundreds of kilograms of meat every week, eliminating transportation,
shortening the supply chain, reducing GHG emissions, saving land and
providing high levels of transparency, increasing trust for
poultry consumers.

SuperMeat believes that providing high transparency and traceability
should be a cornerstone of food production. The launch of the
production-to-fork facility showcases SuperMeat's commitment in that
direction and the potential that cellular agriculture technologies can
bring to the meat industry. An [Innova Market Insights
report](https://www.specialityfoodmagazine.com/food-and-drink/brand-transparency-will-drive-sales#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20by%20Innova,about%20where%20foods%20come%20from.&text=As%20such%2C%20consumers%20want%20more,they%20purchase%20than%20ever%20before.%E2%80%9D)
says transparency will be one of the top trends for the food and drink
industry in 2021. This strive for transparency is becoming more
important as, according to a [NielsenIQ's
survey](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2018/its-clear-transparency-is-driving-fmcg-growth/),
67% of consumers want to know everything that goes into the food
they buy.

According to CEO Ido Savir, "SuperMeat is working closely with local
industries in the US, EU and UAE, to launch facilities similar to The
Chicken around the world in 2022."
