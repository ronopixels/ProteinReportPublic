CHICAGO and SAN LEANDRO (May 18, 2023) -- ADM (NYSE:ADM), a global
leader in sustainably sourced nutrition, and Air Protein, a pioneer in
air-based nutritional protein that requires no agriculture or farmland,
decoupling protein production from traditional supply chain risks,
announced today that they have entered into a Strategic Development
Agreement to collaborate on research and development to further advance
new and novel proteins for nutrition.

The Strategic Development Agreement would combine ADM's broad nutrition,
formulation and research expertise with Air Protein's unique landless
agriculture platform to identify ways to scale cost-effective
ingredients that enable meat substitutes to deliver on their cost,
nutrition, flavor and texture targets. It also provides for the mutually
exclusive rights for ADM and Air Protein to collaborate to build and
operate the world's first Air Protein commercial scale plant.

"Food security and sustainability are two of the enduring trends driving
the growth and evolution of protein demand, and ADM is at the forefront
of expanding the entire protein ecosystem," said Ian Pinner, ADM's
senior vice president, Strategy and Innovation. "We are proud to be a
strategic investor in Air Protein, and with today's agreement, we're
expanding our partnership to bring ADM's industry-leading expertise in
flavors and complete nutrition solutions to help expand the universe of
applications in which Air Protein's technology can be used. To
sustainably feed a growing global population, we need a broad protein
ecosystem, from animal to plant to other novel sources. ADM is proud to
work with both startups and major consumer brands to leverage our full
pantry of capabilities and expand opportunities that innovative
technologies present."

Prior to entering the SDA, ADM has served as a strong supporter of Air
Protein through investment of Series A and SAFE funding, and along with
others including the Ford Foundation, Barclays Sustainable Impact
Capital, Plum Alley, and GV (formerly Google Ventures), Air Protein has
raised \$107 million in cumulative capital. With the funding, Air
Protein has accelerated the expansion of a world-class team of
scientists, manufacturing and food experts, as well as the construction
of its state-of-the-art Air Farmâ„¢ in San Leandro, California.

"Air Protein is excited to extend our relationship with ADM, which has
been a strong supporter and collaborator in our mutual mission to
provide innovative protein solutions that can sustainably feed the
growing global population," stated Air Protein Founder and CEO, Dr. Lisa
Dyson. "Their continued commitment to building a more sustainable food
system has helped us significantly accelerate and scale our Bay Area Air
Farm and other growth initiatives." Dr. Dyson also shared that Air
Protein successfully concluded an important regulatory review confirming
their protein is GRAS, noting that it "represents one more important
milestone on our journey to provide consumers with the protein of the
future."

**About Air Protein**\
Air Protein, founded in 2019, is a pioneer in making air-based protein
that requires no agriculture or farmland. Our first Air Farm facility,
located in San Leandro, CA, will serve as a prototype for the protein
farm of the future. The state-of-the-art facility demonstrates the
making of protein and other ingredients using air, water and energy as
inputs. Air Protein makes protein ingredients that are rich in vitamins
and minerals, flavor proteins, color proteins, and functional proteins
that can deliver on a range of texture applications. The dramatic
difference between Air Protein's landless agriculture platform and all
other ways of making protein is that others depend on land and/or an
agricultural supply chain. This improves both the competitiveness and
stability of production costs as it enables protein production without
traditional supply chain risks (climate, geopolitical, etc.). At Air
Protein, our mission is to accelerate the world's transition to
rainforestfriendly food to sustainably feed the future.
