ALAMEDA, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, September 13, 2022. Shiru, a
functional ingredients discovery company, today announced it was awarded
a key patent on a high-tech approach for discovering proteins for the
food industry. U.S. Patent No. 11,439,159 was issued today and is
entitled "System for identifying and developing individual
naturally-occurring proteins as food ingredients by machine learning and
database mining combined with empirical testing for a target food
function."

The patent describes Shiru's unique approach for revealing the elusive
"sequence-to-food-function" map. Using an iterative
\"predict-build-test\" loop, Shiru first uses state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms to interrogate a database of tens of millions of
naturally occurring non-animal protein sequences for candidate proteins
that have desired functional characteristics. Select candidates are then
screened via high-throughput strain engineering and protein function
assays to identify proteins that can be mass-produced via precision
fermentation. The experimental data are fed back into the models to
continuously improve the accuracy and efficiency of the functional
predictions.

"We've created the most powerful toolbox for alternative proteins in the
plant-based food industry, offering food makers unique and rapid access
to new functional food ingredients," said Jasmin Hume, Shiru Founder &
CEO and lead inventor on the patent. "From improving ingredient
functionality and discovering clean-label alternatives to bringing
disruptive new products to market, our platform helps our partners solve
a wide range of problems."

"The U.S. plant-based foods market is expected to grow to \$7 billion,
driven by consumers and food manufacturers seeking more delicious and
sustainable foods," said Hume. "Systematically finding functional
ingredients is the core of our technology, and the ability to discover
diverse, natural proteins as food ingredients as described in this
patent gives Shiru a competitive advantage that no other company has." 

"This patented process is a key component of our Flourish™ discovery
platform, which is at the heart of Shiru's ability to develop individual
proteins and mixed protein isolates," said Lawrence Lee, Shiru CTO and
patent co-inventor. "The patent protects the value of our existing
technology and also creates new potential value for using naturally
occurring proteins in advanced biomaterials and beyond."

The patent specifies food functions like gelation, moisture retention,
fat structuring, fiber formation, and flavors as targets. The patent
claims the technology's use in developing alternative meat products,
baked goods, and confectionery while describing its use in other
application areas such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

Today's announcement is the latest in Shiru's path to commercialization.
It recently announced partnerships with two leading ingredient companies

including Dean Banks, former Tyson CEO. In May, Shiru moved to its new
headquarters in Alameda, California, where it is scaling up its pilot
facilities to screen and produce a wide range of next-generation
products.

About Shiru

Shiru is an ingredient discovery company on a mission to improve the
sustainability of our food system. Using a combination of machine
learning, bioinformatics, and precision fermentation, Shiru's Flourish
platform uncovers new uses for naturally-occurring proteins as
functional ingredients that can replace animal-based products used in
food today. Founded in 2019, Shiru is developing a growing range of
functional ingredients, with an early focus on gelation, egg
replacement, and structured fats functions. Powered by a team of
technology experts and food industry veterans, Shiru is working to
reduce the world's reliance on animals for food by providing delicious,
cost-effective, healthy, and sustainable alternatives. Shiru is based in
Alameda, California, and is backed by leading venture capital firms such
as S2G Ventures, Lux Capital, and CPT Capital. For more information,
