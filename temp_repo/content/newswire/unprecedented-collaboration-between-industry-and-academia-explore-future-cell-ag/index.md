January 25, 2022 --- The cultivated food industry has seen record levels
of investment and breakthroughs in the past two years. However, academic
curricula still do not cover topics that would prepare students for work
in this field. The Cultivate Tomorrow initiative aims to help bridge
that gap, organizing students from all disciplines to tackle key
challenges in the industry through a cellular agriculture-focused
hackathon, the first of its kind in the US. Cultivate Tomorrow was
initiated and directed by Jasmin Kern, a cultivated food enthusiast and
senior studying Chemistry at MIT. In July 2021, she gathered a group of
passionate and forward-thinking students across US academic institutions
to build this event.

The inaugural Cultivate Tomorrow hackathon is organized into three
tracks: scientific communication, advertising strategy, and innovative
resource use. Each team of 3-5 students is paired with an industry
mentor. The Cultivate Tomorrow team recruited 170 student applicants
from around the country last fall, and currently have nearly 130
students participating.

"From conceptualizing the first nation-wide cultivated food hackathon to
directing the first iteration of Cultivate Tomorrow, I have gotten to
know so many impressive and inspiring people working to revolutionize
the food industry. I am thrilled to see how much new talent has been
waiting for a chance to step into this industry, and that we can offer
them this opportunity," says Jasmin. 

To conclude the Cultivate Tomorrow Hackathon, the organization will host
a virtual pitch day on February 12, 2022. This event will be open to
everyone interested in the cultivated food industry, biotechnology
applications, and sustainable food and agriculture sectors. The event
will feature the hackathon team presentations and awards ceremony. The
event is hosting a panel moderated by Danielle Nierenberg, the president
of Food Tank, on the ethics of the commercialization of cultivated food
products featuring New Harvest Executive Director Isha Datar. To inspire
the new generation of students, a panel on navigating entrepreneurship
and start-ups is scheduled featuring founders, and intrapreneurs in the
industry who will provide insight into running a company in the cell ag
industry.

Benny Larson, PhD and VP of Research and Product Development at Wildtype
believes that "students need to know that there is a big future here in
the new food economy. Bio and chemical engineering students, bioprocess
specialists, and others are likely all plotting the career path right
now to work in pharma, but we need these folks to take a look at other
paths and be able to see cell ag as being able to provide a viable,
sustainable future."

Kicking off the year with this far-reaching event will make 2022 the
biggest year for cultivated food and cell ag yet! This event will foster
collaboration and partnerships between many important players in the
industry from suppliers to food manufacturers, from biotechnology
innovation and research to investing and marketing experts.

**About Cultivate Tomorrow:**

Cultivate Tomorrow is a grassroots initiative launched by students from
MIT, Northwestern, Yale, UW Madison, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San
Diego, UVM, and Ohio State University. The Founder and Director is
Jasmin Kern, currently an undergraduate senior at MIT studying Chemistry
with a focus on Cellular Agriculture. Other organizers include PhD
candidates in Biochemistry and Food Sciences, as well as MBA candidates.
This interdisciplinary team hopes to spark excitement and support for
more sustainable food technologies among students and changemakers. In
November 2021, Cultivate Tomorrow became a member of Nucleate, a
national student-run organization that empowers biotech founders and
facilitates the formation of pioneering life sciences companies.
Together with Nucleate, Cultivate Tomorrow will continue to foster
collaboration and inspire and empower students with a passion for
sustainable food technology.

**Partners of Cultivate Tomorrow:**

The initiative has attracted involvement from exciting startups and
players in the space. Industry mentors include leaders from
groundbreaking startups such as Perfect Day, Wildtype, The Every
Company, BIOMILQ, Tender Food, Higher Steaks, and Mission Barns. The
event is sponsored by Merck KGaA, Turtle Tree, Gingko Bioworks and CULT
Food Science.
