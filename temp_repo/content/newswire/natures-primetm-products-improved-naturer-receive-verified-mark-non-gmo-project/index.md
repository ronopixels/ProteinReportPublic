Nature](http://www.improvednature.com/), a plant-based protein company,
proudly announces that its Nature's PRIME™ products have earned the
Non-GMO Project Verified mark. The Non-GMO Project Product Verification
Program is North America's most rigorous third-party verification for
non-GMO food and products.

"Earning the Verified mark from the Non-GMO Project comes right after
receiving [GHP Magazine's Biotechnology
award](https://improvednature.com/improved-nature-receives-2020-biotechnology-award/)
for the Best Plant-Based Food Product Development Company in the USA,"
said President and CEO of Improved Nature, Dr. Rody Hawkins. "These
distinctions show our customers that we are providing them with the
highest quality sustainable protein available on the market today."

The Non-GMO Project is a mission-driven nonprofit organization dedicated
to building and protecting a non-GMO food supply. The organization
creates the Standard for what it means to be non-GMO and products are
evaluated by independent technical administrators based on that
Standard.

provide healthy nutrition with no artificial ingredients. Improved
Nature is committed to providing Better Protein for a Better Planet®.
