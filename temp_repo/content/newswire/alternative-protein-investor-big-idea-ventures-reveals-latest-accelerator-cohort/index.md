***Big Idea Ventures, global leader in early-stage investments in the
alternative protein sector, revealed its latest accelerator cohort
today.***

Fifteen early-stage startups were selected for pre-seed investment as
part of Big Idea Ventures' bi-annual new protein accelerator program.
Investments were made through the firm's three offices in New York,
Paris and Singapore. Big Idea Ventures' accelerator is part of its New
Protein Fund (\$50M+ AUM), dedicated to early-stage investments in
alternative protein products, ingredients and technologies.

*"With 15 companies from 13 different countries this cohort is our most
diverse to date. It is a testament to the growth of the alternative
protein food industry globally. Every company in this cohort, regardless
of whether they use cell-based, precision fermentation or plant-based
approaches, addresses a specific market gap backed by strong technology,
a great team and the Big Idea Ventures corporate and mentor ecosystem,"
said Andrew D. Ive, Founder and Managing General Partner of Big Idea
Ventures.*

The fifteen companies in Big Idea Ventures' latest global accelerator
cover a wide range of technologies leveraging precision fermentation,
cell-based technologies, and building bioplatforms to unlock the
potential behind unique ingredients.

*New York Accelerator \-- Cohort 5*

-   **The Leaf Protein Co. (Australia) ---** uses novel science and
    technology to unlock the planet's most abundant source of protein,
    Rubisco, from leafy greens. Their aim is to build a library of
    functional, protein-rich ingredients from sustainable sources in a
    market which currently lacks biodiverse and allergen-free plant
    protein ingredients. Their first protein, a foaming and gelling aid,
    is produced from leafy crop by-products.
-   **Optimized Foods (US) ---** harnesses the form, function, and
    structure of mycelium to grow better, healthier foods. Using their
    technology platform, they are creating compelling products starting
    with shelf-stable boba tea and cell-cultured caviar.
-   **CF Foods Group (US) ---** develops CPG products that are cruelty
    and conflict-free, utilizing cultivated proteins as core
    ingredients. The first range of products is premium dog treats, a
    blend of cultured meat and plant-based ingredients that are better
    for people, the planet, and our pups. CF Foods aims to be among the
    first to market cultivated CPG products in both the US and Asia.
-   **Alt Atlas (UK) ---** created a machine learning bioplatform that
    sources functional ingredients and solutions for the alternative
    meat and dairy industry. Their first product is a proprietary
    non-GMO bovine stem cell line and a customized, community-backed
    service to support cultivated meat companies scale-up their
    production by 10X. Their vision is to be the alternative meat and
    dairy lighthouse and enable the industry to realistically achieve
    industrial production by 2030.
-   **The Mushroom Meat Co (US) ---** uses their patent-pending
    technology to make healthy, yet craveable animal-free meats from
    culinary-medicinal mushrooms and upcycled plant proteins. With their
    flexible ingredient platform, the company is addressing the need for
    whole-food and allergen-free meat analogs in the alternative protein
    market.

*Singapore Accelerator \-- Cohort 5*

*"We are proud to announce our first investments in Indonesia, Thailand
and Japan," said Dr Dalal AlGhawas, BIV's Program Director in Singapore.
"This is a testament to the growth of the alternative protein category
in some of the biggest consumer markets in Asia especially for South
East Asia. For these markets product localisation is key and we are
excited to see the emphasis for clean labels and food waste valorisation
too."*

-   **Kabocha Milk Co. (New Zealand) ---** unlocks the incredible health
    properties of Kabocha (pumpkin/squash) in ready-to-eat formats.
    Their first product, the award-winning Kabochamilk, is 100% vegan
    and free of preservatives, artificial colours & flavor, and provides
    50% of your daily Vitamin A in a single serve. Co-funded by the NZ
    government, the team is also developing an alternative protein meat
    pattie from the 15,000 tonnes of imperfect grown Kabocha per year
    that goes to stock food; and from the waste stream of the creation
    of Kabocha Milk.
-   **Meatless Kingdom (Indonesia) ---** develops Indonesian-inspired
    foods and snacks from locally-sourced plant-based ingredients that
    are both tasty and nutritious. They use technology that can combine
    and maximize the beneficial properties of mushroom and soy in order
    to create affordable plant-based meat products which have meaty
    texture and taste. Their products are also high in protein, low in
    gluten, non-MSG and are Halal and BPOM certified.
-   **More Foods (Thailand) ---** specializes in creating functional
    plant-based proteins with bioactive ingredients and innovative
    protein modification technology. Their products are made with a
    variety of plants and fungi which gives consumers an alternative to
    soy, and their method of formulation allows for products that are
    low in sodium, lightly processed, tasty and functional. All of this
    is achieved using environmentally friendly ingredients and a
    zero-waste production process.
-   **Pullulo (Singapore) ---** develops microbial protein for various
    food applications. Their innovative protein is highly nutritious yet
    affordable, allergen-free, non-GMO, vegan, and Halal and is less
    susceptible to supply chain disruptions. Many of their products also
    integrate agricultural bioproducts, upcycling our waste in the
    process. Pullulo is targeting both the alternative protein mass
    market and the underserved healthcare catering and food services.
-   **UMAMI UNITED (Japan) ---** specializes in Japanese-inspired
    plant-based food using unique and innovative Japanese ingredients.
    Their first product - the UMAMI EGG - is made with konjac powder and
    has umami flavour added to it thanks to an innovative enzyme
    process. UMAMI strives for clean labels in their products and has
    made them buddhist-friendly to ensure deeper penetration of the
    greater China market.

*Paris Accelerator \-- Cohort 2*

*"We were impressed by the quality of companies coming through our
applications this year and are delighted to see alternative protein
accelerating in Europe," said Henrietta Hearth, BIV's Program Director
in Paris. "We've seen precision fermentation as a strong technology that
is enabling scientists to create alternative proteins with nutritional
and taste credentials better than their dairy and meat counterparts."*

-   **Cultivated Biosciences (Switzerland) ---** developed a strong
    technology to create an ingredient that adds creaminess to
    plant-based dairy without the need for GMO. The creamy fat is
    naturally produced from the fermentation of oleaginous yeast, and
    can mimic dairy products on sensory and functional grounds, granting
    an easy ingredient swap for the food industry. The team is also able
    to customize the fatty acid profile and protein content of this
    ingredient to suit various kinds of needs for their partners in the
    future.
-   **Genesea (Israel) --- **produces high-quality ingredients from
    macro-algae for the food industry. The algal-protein is extracted
    from seaweeds, offering consumers a carbon-negative, arable
    land-free, fertilizer-free, pesticide-free, and gluten-free protein
    alternative. Their strong scalable technology, backed by industrial
    experience, three patents and dozens of scientific publications,
    allows them to optimize both the cultivation and the extraction
    parts of the business, and reach 92% biomass recovery of raw
    material into useful ingredients.
-   **Mewery (Czech Republic) ---** is the first European cell-based
    food tech startup developing cultivated pork on a microalgae base.
    Their unique technology aims to break down barriers to scaling and
    accelerating the cultivated meat industry. They are developing a
    porcine cell line for a proprietary hybrid media which doesn\'t
    require FBS and uses microalgae growth factors to lower the
    production costs of cultivated meat significantly.
-   **Nutropy (France) ---** produces milk proteins identical to those
    found in cow\'s milk to create premium French cheeses that taste as
    good as conventional ones while supporting the environment, animal
    welfare, and human health. They harness the power of cultures to
    improve the taste, texture, and health benefits of their products.
-   **Väcka (Spain) ---** develops plant-based cheeses, respecting the
    traditional fermentation and aging processes while adding the
    technologies and values of the 21st century. After eight years of
    intensive R&D and the use of original and innovative raw materials
    (such as pumpkin) as substrates, Väcka has built a strong community
    of consumers in Spain and plans to expand globally.
