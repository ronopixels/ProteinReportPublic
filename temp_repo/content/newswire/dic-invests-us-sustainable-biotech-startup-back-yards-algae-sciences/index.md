Tokyo, Japan - **[DIC Corporation](https://www.dic-global.com/en/)** has
completed investment in **[Back of the Yards Algae Sciences Inc.
(BYAS)](https://www.algaesciences.com/)**, a sustainable food technology
startup focused on developing innovative extracts and alternative
proteins, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The move strategically
advances DIC's growing business position in more sustainable and
circular algae-derived products, including natural food colorants,
natural food additives, and biostimulants---vital for improving vertical
farming yields.

BYAS owns proprietary technology for efficiently extracting active
ingredients from biobased materials, notably algae and mycelia. BYAS
currently produces unique products such as food colorants, food
additives, biostimulants. The company's spirulina (cyanobacteria)
algae-based Heme Analog (BYAS-AHA) is receiving intense interest for its
ability to enhance the alternative meat taste and aroma, without the use
of genetically modified organisms (GMO).

Moreover, BYAS' proprietary zero-waste platform effectively utilizes all
ingredients obtained from biobased materials, contributing to both the
improvement of consumer health and the circular economy, perfectly
aligned with DIC's Vision---to improve the human condition by safely
delivering color and comfort for sustainable prosperity.

Since becoming the first company in the world to successfully
commercialize **[Spirulina](https://www.dic-global.com/en/products/health_foods/)** production
in the 1970s, the DIC Group has been a pioneer in Spirulina research,
finding safe ways to use high-quality Spirulina powders and the
Spirulina-derived edible pigment and natural blue food colorant **[Lina
Blue®](https://www.dic-global.com/en/products/natural_colorants/)** in
healthy food products, food materials, and livestock feed, globally.

Through this alliance, DIC and BYAS will share algae mass-culture
technology and functional component extraction technology---that DIC has
long-cultivated in the Spirulina business---to develop new products,
further improve production efficiency, reducing waste, and improving
sustainability through the more-effective use of natural resources.

Moreover, in collaboration with Parsippany, New Jersey-based Sun
Chemical Corporation---a DIC Group member company operating in the
United States and Europe---DIC plans to expand product sales globally
while developing new applications.

The DIC Group delivers safe, high-quality products to consumers. By
strengthening its bio-based materials business, focused on Biomaterial
Design in the healthcare field, DIC continues to enhance its
contributions to Quality of Life (QOL) as set forth in its new long-term
management plan DIC Vision 2030.
