Oliver Katz, Conference Producer for the Future Food-Tech series hosted
by Rethink Events, said "We're delighted to be working with Quorn Foods
and Roquette to launch these Innovation Challenges to stimulate new
solutions to the most pressing issues facing today's food producers, and
give start-ups the opportunity to partner with corporate leaders to
scale their innovations. I can't wait to learn about new solutions from
ambitious innovators and how they propose to tackle two major challenges
facing the future of food."

**QUORN FOODS CHALLENGE: Technologies Helping to Achieve a Poultry Whole
Muscle Food Experience**

Using mycoprotein or other sustainable, natural ingredients, Quorn Foods
is looking for companies leveraging technology to create realistic
poultry whole muscle shapes, textures and flavours.

Companies applying could be delivering a full product or addressing one
of the key challenges associated with creating a whole cut, plant-based
experience.

The products could be cooked in a range of ways such as in casseroles,
grilled or roasted, or could be eaten as a chilled, deli-style product.

Tim Ingmire, SVP R&D at Quorn Foods says: *\"As the original pioneer of
alternative protein, and leading global meat-free brand, we recognize
the importance of creating delicious, nutritious food that supports the
adoption of more sustainable diets. Building on our leading position in
chicken analogues we\'re looking for breakthroughs to allow us to mimic
the experience of cooking with whole chicken cuts.\"*

**ROQUETTE CHALLENGE: Plant-Based Products Offering New Gastronomic
Experiences to the Consumer**

As a pioneer in plant proteins, Roquette is looking to collaborate and
innovate with product companies developing new foods that will
contribute to a new plant-based gastronomy.

These new cuisines will offer new tastes, textures and whole new
gastronomic experiences, using plant-based ingredients that are better
for people and for the planet.

Roquette looks forward to seeing a dazzling array of new cuisines, and
to collaborating with food innovators to help them get to market faster.
Categories encompass plant-based meat, dairy, drinks, nutrition and
bakery.

Sergio Neves, Head of Open Innovation at Roquette says: *"As a key
supplier of alternative proteins, we see a tremendous opportunity for a
food revolution with plant-based food. To enable this revolution
requires a new generation of creative food entrepreneurs in a new food
ecosystem. Thanks to this Future Food-Tech challenge, we aim to
highlight companies that will create novel and differentiated
plant-based food & nutrition products and shape this future food
ecosystem."*
