**Food-Tech Start-Ups are Invited to Submit Solutions that Improve the
Texture and Functionality of Plant-Based Cheese OR Natural Ingredients
for Use in Foods that Support Immunity, Energy and Sleep.**

APPLICATIONS ARE NOW OPEN until January 31. Apply now at:
[www.futurefoodtechsf.com/innovation-challenges/#APPLYNOW](http://www.futurefoodtechsf.com/innovation-challenges/#APPLYNOW)

**Oliver** **Katz**, *Conference* *Producer* at **Future**
**Food**-**Tech** says *"We're delighted to be working with Danone North
America and Givaudan to launch these Innovation Challenges to highlight
and scale solutions to some of the most fundamental challenges facing
food producers. The Innovation Challenges provide start-ups with the
opportunity to collaborate with corporate leaders and access top-level
support, expertise and facilities to scale their solutions. We can't
wait to hear from a diverse range of ambitious start-ups on how they
plan to address these two major challenges."*

**DANONE NORTH AMERICA CHALLENGE: Technologies to Improve the Texture
and Melting Properties of Plant-Based Cheese**

Danone North America is growing its plant-based cheese category, and one
of the main challenges is delivering the texture and melting properties
associated with traditional dairy.

Its innovation and R&D team is looking for technologies that deliver
more functionality to cheese alternatives, replicating its stretch and
melting properties. Danone North America is interested in shredded or
sliced cheeses such as mozzarella or cheddar, rather than artisan
cheeses.

It is seeking technologies that are both ready to be applied in the
short term, like plant-based extrusion, as well as microbial
fermentation and cell-culturing that\'ll likely be implemented in the
medium to longer-term. Applicants should, at a minimum, have proof of
principle and prototypes.

**Takoua Debeche*,*** *Chief Research and Innovation Officer * at **
Danone North America** shares: **** \"Danone North America is a leader
in plant-based food & beverage, including the growing cheese alternative
category with our So Delicious Dairy Free and Follow Your Heart brands.
Plant-based cheese alternatives is also one of the most technically
challenging categories when it comes to dairy alternatives, especially
when it comes to stretch and melt because casein is the only protein
known to deliver those functionalities. I am very excited to partner
with Future Food-Tech on new and innovative ways to solve this challenge
collaboratively and to see the entrepreneurial ideas that come to the
forefront.\"

**GIVAUDAN CHALLENGE: Natural Ingredients that Support Immunity, Energy
and Sleep**

For consumers around the world, health has taken center stage, with
challenges that range from pandemics and stress to performance pressure
at both work and at home.

Givaudan Taste & Wellbeing strives to support all aspects of
healthfulness with its Health Essentials and Wellness Essentials, a
selection of natural solutions that meet many of today's most common
health needs, including immune system support, mind, energy and
wellbeing.

In this challenge Givaudan is looking for science-driven start-ups who
are working on natural, clean label ingredients for use in food that
support consumers by boosting immunity, energy, and sleep.

It is most interested in companies who, at a minimum, have proof of
principle and prototypes, and its preference is for companies that are
clinically backed.

**Fabio** **Campanile**, *Global Head of Science & Technology, Taste &
Wellbeing* at **Givaudan** shares: "Creative thinking that leads to true
innovation is reliant on collaboration and co-creation and we have found
that this mentality works beautifully between Givaudan and start-up
companies. Together, we\'re able to get further faster, and often
better. We\'ve now partnered with Future Food-Tech for a number of years
and know that this is the place to pose a challenge focused on the
development of ingredients that help boost immunity, mind, energy and
sleep."
