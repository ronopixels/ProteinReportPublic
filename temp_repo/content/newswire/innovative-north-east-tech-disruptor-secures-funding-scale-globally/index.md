Northstar-backed technology disruptor CellulaREvolution, which aims to
revolutionise the way cells are grown at industrial scale, has secured
£380,000 in funding to grow the company - a spin out from Newcastle
University.

CellulaREvolution has identified a significant opportunity in how to
make the culturing of cells more efficient and affordable, which will
benefit medical and pharmaceutical industries, and also the
fast-increasing interest in cultured meat.

CellulaREvolution is the first company in the region to benefit from the
North East Angel R&D programme, an initiative backed by Innovate UK and
managed by Northstar, to attract increased angel investment into early
stage tech businesses. On top of £140,000 from the North East Innovation
Fund, supported by the European Regional Development Fund and managed by
Northstar Ventures, the company has also been awarded a total £200,000
in grants from InnovateUK and a further £40,000 investment from a
private Angel investor.

The company was founded in December 2018 and officially spun-out from
Newcastle University in July 2019. The three company founders are
Martina Miotto (CSO), Che Connon (CTO) and Leo Groenewegen (CEO).

Co-founder and CTO, Professor Che Connon said, "Whether it's for the
cultured meat, cell therapy or biologics production the need for new
ways to grow large numbers of cells in serum free culture is critical to
the continued success of these markets. Our plans to generate a
bioreactor capable of continuous cell production will become a milestone
in the industrialisation of adherent cell manufacture."

Alex Buchan, Northstar Ventures Investment Director, said "Northstar has
been the main investor in North East University spin-outs since 2005,
their potential is huge, with the expertise and innovation the teams
bring. We are very impressed with the CellulaREvolution team, they have
a clearly identified market opportunity and a ground breaking, scalable
solution. We are looking forward to supporting them in their growth and
scaling their company globally. We are also pleased that they are the
first company to benefit from the new North East Angel R&D programme.
Working with Angels has always been core to our offering and this
programme enables access to a combination of funds to really accelerate
the growth of scalable businesses."

Leo Groenewegen CEO of CellulaREvolution said, "We're delighted to have
the backing from Northstar. It will allow us to become the market leader
in the field of continuous cell production. The growing demand for
cultured meat, for example, is a potentially multitrillion USD market
and we aim to get our fair share of this. The investment also lets us
accelerate our product and company development which in turn leads to an
increase in company valuation."
