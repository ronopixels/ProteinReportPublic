-   *Japanese biotechnology startup announces* Cellament®️*, a
    cell-cultured ingredient for skin repair developed using
    revolutionary cellular agriculture technology*
-   *This new product unleashes the previously untapped nutritional
    power of eggs by selectively cultivating egg cells instead of
    harvesting whole, chicken-laid eggs*
-   *Cellament is among the first cellular agriculture products ready
    for large-scale commercialization*

**TOKYO, JAPAN** --- IntegriCulture Inc., the Japanese biotechnology
startup pioneering revolutionary advancements in cellular agriculture,
**today announced the launch of Cellament®️, the first in a new
generation of bioactive skincare ingredients based on cutting-edge
cell-culture technology**.

Cellament harnesses the unique nutritional power of eggs but surpasses
them in both growth factors and proteins. The result is a cell-cultured
serum rich in antioxidants that aid in skin recovery, offering a radical
new solution for skin repair while marking a significant step forward
for the cellular agriculture industry.

"Cell-culture technology doesn't just change how we source traditionally
animal-derived ingredients, it also enables us to unlock nutritional and
functional power that was previously inaccessible," explains
**IntegriCulture Founder and CEO, Yuki Hanyu. "**There's never been a
product like Cellament before, and certainly not one ready for scalable
commercialization. This is a significant milestone for cellular
agriculture and for the skincare industry."

IntegriCulture spent years researching cell-cultured serum applications
in cosmetics. As the body's largest organ, skin requires proper
nutrients for optimal health, and few sources offer as complete a
nutritional profile as eggs. By selectively cultivating three types of
egg cells --- the amnion, yolk sac, and plasma membrane ---
IntegriCulture can amplify the potency of key nutritional elements far
beyond levels found in chicken-laid eggs, and with significantly greater
resource efficiency than conventional chicken farming. These three
substances are then combined to create the serum comprising the base of
Cellament, which can be used in a wide variety of
cosmetics formulations.

Cellament has been shown to:

-   Inhibit between 10-70% of enzymatic activity that degrades
    skin elasticity
-   Accelerate the production of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a
    protein that facilitates faster skin cell turnover, increasing skin
    smoothness while also preventing wrinkle formation
-   Increase the production of enzymes and proteins associated with
    keratinocyte moisture retention --- 90% of the skin's outermost
    layer is made up of such keratinocytes --- while also decreasing the
    production of enzymes that lead to skin dryness
-   Target free-radical processes that accelerate disease and aging by
    reducing OH radicals and lipid peroxidation, thereby reducing the
    unwanted blemishes, pigmentation, and wrinkles associated with aging
-   Inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines responsible for
    skin redness by mitigating UV damage
-   Reduce sebaceous pore size and sebum secretion, which mitigated acne
    and blackheads in an 8-week trial

**The Cellament breakthrough was** **made possible by IntegriCulture's
unique CulNet System™ technology**. Standard cell-culture systems have
faced serious scalability bottlenecks due to the high costs of special
nutrients called growth factors, which typically need to be purchased
and fed to target cells in inefficient batch processes. In contrast,
IntegriCulture's CulNet System replicates the physiology and
biochemistry of the body's internal organs to produce its own growth
factors. "CulNet continuously produces, recycles, and optimizes growth
factors to meet the needs of the cells they feed. This solves one of the
industry's greatest challenges toward achieving scalability and cost
reduction for cell-cultured products," said IntegriCulture CTO Dr.
Ikko Kawashima.

**About IntegriCulture**

Established in 2015, IntegriCulture is a Tokyo-based biotechnology
startup advancing cell-culture technologies. The company's CulNet System
allows for the large-scale production of cell-based biomaterials,
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, supplements, and food products for the first
time in history. In 2020, IntegriCulture was awarded \$2.2 million by
Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization to
establish a commercial production facility. IntegriCulture founder Yuki
Hanyu was also instrumental in establishing the Shojinmeat Project, a
DIY citizen-science community dedicated to open-sourcing cell-based meat
research. To learn more about IntegriCulture and the CulNet System,
