*The growing demand for food and sustainable food production are global
challenges. A significant part of the problem is the lack of sustainably
produced protein feed. eniferBio has developed a new and sustainable
production process for a high-quality fish feed ingredient and recently
received funding for its solution from two funds, Nordic FoodTech VC and
Voima Ventures.*

Fish is healthier and more ecological source of protein than meat and
its consumption is constantly increasing. The decline in fish stocks has
led to the increased fish farming which, in turn, is limited to the
availability of sustainably produced feed. eniferBio has developed a
method for producing Pekilo mycoprotein - a form of single cell protein
derived from fungi. Pekilo mycoprotein is nutritious and protein rich
cell biomass and can be used as raw material for fish feed. It is
produced from biorefineries' underutilised and renewable organic raw
material streams. Pekilo mycoprotein can replace soy, which is commonly
used in fish feed. Soy cultivation poses ecological challenges such as
the deforestation in South America.

The Pekilo single cell protein production method was originally
developed in Finland by the forest industry as early as the 1970s. As
the pulp industry developed, the by-products required for manufacturing
depleted, but today similar by-products continue to be generated in
other industries. eniferBio has modernised this protein production
method with new biotechnology and now applies it to the fish feed
production. The technology has been tested and optimised in VTT\'s
business incubator, VTT LaunchPad.

"We have demonstrated that the single cell protein manufacturing process
works with a variety of industrial by-products which are available
globally in huge quantities. There is scope to replace all the soy
protein concentrate used in fish feeds today, a market currently of \$ 2
billion and growing fast. In addition, we have reformed the process so
that the produced protein meets the high quality requirements for fish
feed. The production method is sustainable and enables protein
self-sufficiency. The results show that with this method we can build a
profitable business," describes **Simo Ellilä**, the founder of
eniferBio.

With the support of VTT LaunchPad, eniferBio has built networks with the
relevant industry partners and fish feed producers. Both parties are
interested in the solution. The next step is the preparation for pilot
production.

"We negotiate with side stream producers and optimise our process for
the selected side stream. The number of biorefineries is growing
globally and they want to utilise the by-products of their production.
It is a new source of income for biorefineries. We have already
successfully tested side stream samples from all across the world -
India, Thailand, Brazil and Canada. Our objective is to start pilot
production of single-cell protein in the beginning of 2021 and to
produce enough protein on a fast schedule, which can be tested by the
fish feed producers. From there the next step is to build a first
industrial scale plant in Europe, before starting to export the concept
further afield," says Ellilä.

eniferBio's technology is on the cutting edge of time as
resource-efficient solutions to major global problems are currently
being sought. As a result of Covid-19, self-sufficiency and security
have become increasingly more important. As we emerge from the crisis,
investments will focus even more on sustainable solutions.

**Investors include Nordic FoodTech VC and Voima Ventures**

eniferBio is financed by Nordic FoodTech VC, which invests in the food
technology, and Voima Ventures, which invests in science-based deep tech
startups. For the main investor, Nordic FoodTech VC, this is the first
investment in Finland while both investors are also investing in VTT\'s
spin-off company for the first time.

"Nordic cutting-edge research provides significant solutions to global
food challenges. The continuous change the world is facing is reflected
in eniferBio's solution. In the 1990s, global resources were considered
abundant and there was no need for the production of Pekilo protein with
its production run down in the early 1990s. Now, however, this
historical Finnish invention in its developed form is more relevant than
ever. Nordic FoodTech VC\'s investment strategy is well suited to
investing in technology that produces protein from unused by-products
into a growing area of ​​food production," states **Mika Kukkurainen**
from Nordic FoodTech VC.

\"eniferBio combines the elements of a good startup very nicely. Finnish
sustainable development innovation has been scientifically further
refined and is now being commercialised by an entrepreneurial research
team", complements Pontus Stråhlman from Voima Ventures.

**VTT LaunchPad\'s first spin-off**

VTT LaunchPad has been operating over a year and the business incubator
has nine teams that aim to commercialise VTT\'s research and technology
as spin-off companies. eniferBio is the business incubator's first
startup company. This is also an important milestone for VTT LaunchPad.

\"eniferBio has proven its technology works. In addition, the eniferBio
team has shown its ability to adapt to change and move forward with
determination. This is an encouraging example of how a new technology
can be converted into a startup,\" states Lotta Partanen, the manager of
VTT LaunchPad.
