*Scientists prove cell-cultured meat products can offer enhanced
nutrition compared to conventionally produced meat*

A group of researchers at Tufts University have genetically engineered
cow muscle cells to produce plant nutrients not natively found in beef
cells. Using the same carotenoid pathway exploited in golden rice, they
coaxed bovine cells into producing beta carotene---a provitamin usually
found in carrots and tomatoes.

In doing so, they demonstrated that cell-cultured meat might be able to
surpass the nutritional profile of conventionally farmed meat.

"Cows don't have any of the genes for producing beta carotene," said
Andrew Stout, lead author of the study and biomedical engineering PhD
student at Tufts University. "We engineered cow muscle cells to produce
this and other phytonutrients, which in turn allows us to impart those
nutritional benefits directly onto a cultured meat product in a way that
is likely infeasible through animal transgenics and conventional
meat production."

These findings, published in the journal *Metabolic Engineering*, are
proof of principle for using genetic engineering and cellular
agriculture to create novel foods. Rather than simply mimicking meat
currently found in the grocery store, cell-cultured meat products are
capable of assuming different shapes, textures, nutritional profiles,
and bioactivities.

One such feature is carcinogenicity, or rather, the lack thereof.

"We saw a reduction in lipid oxidation levels when we cooked a small
pellet of these cells when they were expressing and producing this beta
carotene," said Stout. "Because that lipid oxidation is one of the key
mechanistic proposals for red and processed meats' link to diseases such
as colorectal cancer, I think that there is a pretty compelling argument
to be made that this could potentially reduce that risk."

Nutritionally enhancing cultured meat products might give the burgeoning
cellular agriculture industry the leg up it needs to compete with
conventional meat. Although cultured meat producers have exponentially
lowered the cost of production over the last few years, the technology
faces an uphill battle in competing with a heavily subsidized
status quo.

"It will likely be challenging for cultured meat to be competitively
priced with factory farmed meat right out of the gate," said David
Kaplan, Stern Family Professor of Engineering at the Tufts University
School of Engineering and corresponding author of the study. "A
value-added product which provides consumers with added health benefits
may make them more willing to pay for a cultured meat product."
