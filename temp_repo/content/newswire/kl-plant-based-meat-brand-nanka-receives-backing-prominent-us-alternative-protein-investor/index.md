***Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia*** - LF Growth Fund announced today the
completion of investment into Kuala Lumpur plant-based meat brand Nanka,
which produces a range of delicious and healthy meat alternatives based
on jackfruit and plant protein. LF Growth Fund, the investment arm of
United States-based Lever Foundation, is one of the most active
investors in the alternative protein category in Asia, having backed 17
startups in the category over the past two years across Mainland China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and now also Malaysia.

Founded by F&B veteran Ahmad Syafik Jaafar and food technologist Amirah
Mohd Noh, Nanka entered the plant-based meat market in Malaysia with its
signature jackfruit-based burger patties. The company has since
developed a variety of additional meat alternatives including nuggets,
balls, hotdogs, and minced meat. Jackfruit, which is native to Malaysia
and grows all year round, is resistant to diseases and high temperatures
and adds a fibrous meat-like texture to plant-based meat. 

"Nanka\'s mission is to provide Malaysian customers with unique,
delicious plant-based meat products at a reasonable price, benefiting
both people\'s taste buds and the environment. Compared to traditional
protein sources, our products have a minimal carbon footprint. We are
thrilled that the Lever Foundation has decided to support our project to
develop domestic plant-based meat delicacies in Malaysia," said Ahmad
Syafik Jaafar, co-founder of Nanka.

"Public interest in plant-based meat is growing quickly in Malaysia,
with more consumers choosing plant-based products to improve their
health or protect the environment and animal welfare," said Vilosha
Sivaraman, Sustainability Program Manager for Lever Foundation in
Malaysia. "We were impressed by Nanka's innovative and tasty products
and their marketing strategy, and look forward to partnering with them
to help increase production and bring their products to more stores and
restaurants."

A recent study by the Department of Agribusiness at [Universiti Putra
Malaysia](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Universiti+Putra+Malaysia&ludocid=16324123213291490292&gsas=1&client=safari&lsig=AB86z5VsZb-F8kJz_4qD8WA6Go9X&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjm-JqkybT2AhX2kokEHTTgDroQ8G0oAHoECD0QAQ)
(UPM) found that 86% of Malaysian consumers aim to purchase more "green
foods"---more sustainable, safe, healthy and humane food products. The
market for plant-based meat is expected to grow rapidly across the APAC
region, with UBS projecting a 19% compound annual growth rate over the
next five years.
