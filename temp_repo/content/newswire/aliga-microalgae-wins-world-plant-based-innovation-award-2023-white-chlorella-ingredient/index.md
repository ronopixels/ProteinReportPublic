**\[Hjørring, Denmark, 25th of September 2023]** — Aliga Microalgae, a pioneering Danish company specializing in Chlorella algae production for the food-, beverage-, dietary supplements and feed industry, proudly announces its victory at the prestigious Plant Based World Expo 2023 held at the Javits Center in New York. 

In a highly competitive final featuring eight exceptional candidates, Aliga Microalgae emerged as the winner of "The World Plant Based Innovation Award 2023" in the coveted category of "Ingredient Innovation."

Aliga Microalgae's innovative approach to chlorella production has ushered in a new era for the dietary supplement and plant-based food industries. Their proprietary white chlorella, which boasts a neutral color and taste, has captured the attention of industry experts and consumers alike. 

This groundbreaking achievement was made possible by the strategic removal of chlorophyll – the green pigment responsible for the characteristic color and taste of chlorella – from the algae's DNA string through random mutagenesis.

Unlike traditional green chlorella, Aliga Microalgae's white chlorella opens doors to a wider array of food and beverage applications where the green color and typical algae taste are undesirable. This innovation aligns perfectly with the growing demand for versatile plant-based ingredients that can cater to diverse consumer preferences.

Aliga Microalgae is already in the commercial phase of introducing their white chlorella as a dietary supplement in Europe. Furthermore, they have embarked on over 100 trials with vegan food producers worldwide, exploring the potential of white chlorella as an alternative ingredient to commonly used protein sources such as soy and pea protein.

David Erlandsson, Sales Director of Aliga Microalgae, expressed his delight at receiving this prestigious award, stating, "We are thrilled and honored to be recognized with 'The World Plant Based Innovation Award 2023' in the Ingredient Innovation category. This accolade resonates with the remarkable outcomes we are witnessing in our trials. The use of white chlorella opens up a world of innovation in the food and beverage industry. It offers unique functionalities that set it apart from soy and pea protein-based alternatives."

The accolade marks a significant milestone for Aliga Microalgae, underlining their commitment to revolutionizing the dietary supplement and plant-based food sectors with groundbreaking innovations. Their white chlorella is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable, plant-based nutrition.
