*The investment will drive EVERY's breakthrough platform and mission to
bring animal-free protein to everyone, everywhere*

South San Francisco, February 1, 2023 -- The EVERY Co. (\"EVERY®\"), a
pioneering food tech company that is accelerating the world's transition
to animal-free protein, announced that Anne Hathaway has invested in its
platform.

The announcement comes as EVERY scales up following seven years of R&D,
recently launching three products in 12 months and ushering in a new era
for nutritious, delicious protein-boosted foods with a lighter
environmental footprint. This is Hathaway's first investment in a B2B
company.

"The need to transform our food system has never been clearer or more
urgent," noted Hathaway. "An important piece of the puzzle is in
nature-equivalent animal proteins, such as EVERY has been developing.
I'm proud to back this vision of a better future."

The news dovetails with the rise of proteins made by fermentation.
Investments in platforms like EVERY's---which uses fermentation science
to "brew" proteins without animals or the climate impacts of factory
farms---totaled \$1.7 billion in a recent period.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) An
early leader in the space, EVERY is the creator of the world's first
animal-free pepsin and egg proteins.

"We are thrilled to partner with visionary investors like Anne to drive
forward our plans to reimagine the way we feed and nourish the world,"
said EVERY CEO Arturo Elizondo. "Ultimately, our vision is to deliver
animal-free protein to everyone, everywhere---and help set the table for
the better food future we all deserve."

EVERY's proteins are crucial solutions to securing a sustainable protein
supply as the global population swells, putting pressure on food
systems. Hathaway---who was drawn to impact investing after making
lifestyle adjustments to reduce her consumption of meat and single-use
plastics, and to embrace a zero waste approach---credits EVERY's impact,
technology and nutrition advantages as key drivers in her interest in
the company.

Indistinguishable from traditional animal protein, EVERY's egg proteins
are crafted with significantly less land, water and greenhouse gas
emissions than comparable conventional animal proteins.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)
When incorporated into foods and beverages, they deliver equivalent
taste, nutrition, texture and function, with enhanced product
performance outcomes for partners.

To date, EVERY has partnered with leading food and beverage brands to
release versatile offerings ranging from a [boosted green

Looking ahead, EVERY plans to broaden its reach to additional
categories, offering an expanding range of food and beverage offerings
that will help transform protein delivery, democratize nutrition
availability, and offer realistic solutions for the climate emergency.

Hathaway joins the likes of notable EVERY investors Bloom8, McWin Food
Systems Fund, Temasek, TO Ventures, Grosvenor, ZX Ventures and others
who have collectively infused over \$230 million in EVERY to date.
Currently scaling up production with BioBrew from AB InBev, the world's
largest fermentation company, EVERY is well positioned to drive the next
wave of food systems innovation.
