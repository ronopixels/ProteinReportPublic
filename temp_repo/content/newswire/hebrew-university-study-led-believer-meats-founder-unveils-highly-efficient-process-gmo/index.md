Jerusalem, Israel --Â The Hebrew University of Jerusalem announced today
the publication of a groundbreaking study in the prestigious journal
[Nature
Foods](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00658-w__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8Fo1a5fJw$),
demonstrating a comprehensive cost efficient production method of
cultured chicken.

In a study led by Professor Yaakov Nahmias, the Founder, President and
Chief Technology Officer of [Believer
Meats](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.believermeats.com/__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8G2ZTxYzQ$),
researchers produced immortal cells lines of chicken fibroblasts using a
process of spontaneous immortalization patented by the company last
year. In contrast to others in the field, the process does not require
genetic modifications, and thus the product is uniquely non-GMO.

"Genetic modifications can introduce unintended mutations that increase
risk of immunological reactions, and thus we chose to avoid them
completely," said Prof. Nahmias. "One issue of concern in the field, is
whether the immortalization process leads to the production of
cancer-forming cell lines. However, the work showed that the process
developed by our group resulted in cells with normal DNA repair
mechanism and without the ability to form tumors."

Public demand for transparency in food production has been rapidly
growing this past decade driven by reports of food borne disease
breakouts and videos of animal cruelty. [Recent report from the Food
Industry Association
(FMI)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nielseniq.com/global/en/news-center/2022/consumer-demand-for-food-transparency-remains-strong-as-omnichannel-rises/__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8E7qJ9D_Q$)
suggests that two-thirds of consumers prefer brands that tell the whole
story about how their products are made, and how safe and sustainable
they are. This increased demand for more humane, safe, and sustainable
methods of meat production accelerated the public excitement for
lab-grown or cultured meat. Consumer research studies show that American
consumers are eager to try cultured meat, without fully understanding
its method of production. Regretfully, most cultured meat companies hold
their methods of production as trade secrets, disclosing little
information on product composition and safety.

"We strongly believe that honesty is the best policy," said Prof.
Nahmias. "As a parent, I am eternally worried about the nutrition of my
children. I want to know that what I give them to eat is safe, healthy,
and preferably sustainable. We wanted to ensure that everyone knows
where our cell lines came from, how stable and safe they are. That our
efficiency is a made matter of public information, leading to a robust
and sustainable production of lab-grown meat that everyone can afford."

Another unique aspect of the study was the demonstration that
spontaneous cells grown in suspension could be produced in densities of
over to 100 billion cells per liter, more than 17-times the industrial
standard. This effectively increases the process yields from 2% to 36%
weight per volume. Explains Nahmias, "By analogy, this would allow one
to produce about 880 pounds of meat, or about a cow a month, from a
vessel the size of a typical refrigerator."

The team then showed the effective differentiation of fat cells that
produced the distinct aroma and flavor of chicken meat.

"We developed a highly efficient differentiation process that uses
natural soy lecithin to turn fibroblasts to fat cells in under a week,"
said Nahmias. "Combining the cultured cells with plant proteins produced
hybrid products in which the aroma and flavor came from lab-grown cells
and the proteins were a blend of cells and plant proteins. The paper
goes to show a significant preference for lab-grown chicken product in
consumer testing."

Taken together, the paper breaks that "big wall of no" described by Paul
Wood and David Humbrid in last year's [Counter
article](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/__;!!DlCMXiNAtWOc!0aghbuFbHPChUYK0283xrj90Xi7QtTZk6Up0N1a_w6cVONBWsIs7UXIn5tklz-UegM3PXt_MhMFm6flex8E5Yx1zlA$)
that challenged the feasibility of lab-grown meat. The Counter analysis
assumed a maximum density of 22 to 65 billion cells per liter, and
expensive growth factors that are not required by fibroblasts. A
production density of 100 billion cells per liter, cuts average
projected costs by 3-folds, to about \$7.5 per pound of biomass, or
\$3.3 per pound of hybrid product, within the price range of commercial
chicken manufacturing.

Nahmias concludes, "Rising global food companies, like Believer Meats,
must commit to full transparency. My kids want to know how their
hamburger is made, and I need to look them in the eye and explain why
the food I serve them is healthy, safe and sustainable. We must ensure
that we, as an industry, provide all the scientific data and information
to the public. If we do not rise to this challenge, consumers will
search and find disinformation from charlatans online. I want to lead
this conversation."
