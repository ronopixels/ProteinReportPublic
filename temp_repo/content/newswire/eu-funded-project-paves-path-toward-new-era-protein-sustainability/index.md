**Netherlands -- April 19, 2023** -- An ultra-sustainable new protein
source made its debut at a meeting of European agrifood industry leaders
and researchers in Turin, Italy on Wednesday, April 12, 2023. During the
biannual gathering of partners in the EU-funded [Plenitude
project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/plenitudeeu/), consortium
members were served mycoprotein-based "chicken style" filets, produced
using bioprocess technology developed to address modern challenges of
global protein sustainability. The tasting marks a key milestone toward
the ingredient's upcoming launch in European markets.

Mycoprotein is a highly nutritious food derived from fungi. While
mycoprotein-based foods have been available for decades, food ingredient
company ENOUGH led the Plenitude project's development of a new
technology that enables minimal-waste production by utilizing renewable
feedstock and upcycling its byproducts in a circular fermentation
bioprocess. The result is ABUNDA---a B2B mycoprotein ingredient food
manufacturers can use to create a broad range of clean label,
nutritious, delicious food products.

"Achieving a new level of sustainable and scalable mycoprotein
production was only half the battle. We also needed to ensure ABUNDA's
culinary performance and sensory attributes are best in class while
making it affordable for consumers," said Craig Johnston, cofounder and
director of strategic partnerships at Enough. "We completed the
construction of the flagship plant and are ready for scalable
production. The results of today's tasting, alongside the incredible
products of our project partners, show we are truly entering a new era
for protein-rich foods." 

The Turin meeting menu additionally featured dishes from global agrifood
giants, flavor and fragrance specialists, and leading plant-based food
companies, also partners in the Plenitude project committed to
developing new-generation meat substitutes using ABUNDA:

-   Global meat company ABP -- No Pork Pieces
-   Plant-based meat company Vivera -- Shawarma Kebab
-   Flavor and fragrance company IFF -- "Beef" Rendang
-   Global agrifood giant Cargill -- Plant-based Burger

All menu items were prepared and served by [Van Ver
Burger](https://www.vanverburger.it/), a traveling Italian food truck
specializing in sustainable gastronomy.

"ABUNDA is one of the best plant-based chickens we have tried so far.
Its taste and texture are just like real chicken. We love its
versatility in applications and we can't wait to have it on our menu,"
said Pasquale Digiglio and Daniele Paradisi, cofounders and chefs at Van
Ver Burger.

"Getting feedback from highly skilled chefs and foodservice
operators---as well as consumers---is critical for validating the
product and ensuring it can have the impact the world needs," commented
Michael Kilkie, head of culinary at Enough. "We focus on making Abunda
so easy to cook that there is not much learning curve for chefs."

**The technology**

Unlike plant proteins, mycoprotein utilizes glucose as feedstock to grow
fungal proteins in a fermentation process with strong nutritional and
sensory profiles for meat substitutes. The Plenitude project's core
technology is centered around a novel integrated bioprocess for making
mycoprotein. In Sas van Gent, Netherlands, the world's first such
facility has been built alongside a Cargill biorefinery producing
bioethanol. The plant, operated by ENOUGH , utilizes on-site glucose
production, then returns its waste streams back to the biorefinery where
they become bioethanol.

**Sustainability**

To assess the project's sustainability, life cycle assessment
consultancy [Life Cycle Engineering](http://www.lcengineering.eu/) will
be conducting detailed analyses of the technology's resource usage and
potential for improving the environmental footprint of modern protein
production. Preliminary results suggest that Abunda has significantly
lower environmental impact than animal proteins.

**About Plenitude**

Plenitude is a 5.5-year, 10-partner, multidisciplinary consortium of
European agrifood industry experts established with €16.9 million in
funding from the [Circular Bio-based Europe Joint
Undertaking](https://www.cbe.europa.eu/projects/plenitude). The
project's purpose is to help to meet Europe's growing demand for
protein-rich foods without the impacts on CO2 emissions or biodiversity
associated with the production of conventional animal-based proteins.
Project partners include ENOUGH, Cargill, Vivera, ABP, IFF, Bridge2Food,
Life Cycle Engineering, Lactips, Mosa Meat, and Wageningen University &
Research. For more information and project updates, visit the [Plenitude
