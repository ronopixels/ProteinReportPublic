FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**New York microalgae company closes capital raise via Harvest Returns
platform**

Fort Worth, Texas, November 17, 2020 -- Brooklyn, New York-based We Are
The New Farmers, Inc. announced today that it has successfully completed
a pre-seed round totaling \$335,000 on the Harvest Returns agriculture
crowdfunding platform.

We Are The New Farmers is a controlled-environment agriculture company
that produces spirulina microalgae, one of the most nutrient dense foods
on the planet. The climate change and disaster resilient technology the
farm utilizes is unparalleled in sustainability and cost-efficiency. The
company plans to use the capital raised to build a new facility to
increase their production.

"We believe that microalgae will be an integral part of the solution
that we need to fix our food system," said Jonas Guenther, co-founder of
We Are The New Farmers. "Cultivation of microalgae is incredibly
resilient and only needs a fraction of the resources compared to more
traditional crops. Our mission is to unlock the powers of microalgae,
establishing it as a building block of a circular food system. We are
incredibly excited to be the first successful microalgae farm on Harvest
Returns, who have been extremely valuable partners on our fundraising
journey. Thanks to Harvest Returns, we are one step closer to achieving
our mission."

We Are The New Farmers sells fresh spirulina online and in select local
grocery stores. The company has recently expanded to being the first and
only company to offer frozen spirulina cubes in retail. The conveniently
pre-portioned cubes are flash-frozen at peak freshness with
significantly higher bio-availability of nutrients than dried powder and
offer a better flavor profile. One cube is equal to a full day's fresh
greens, and two cubes provide the same amount of protein as a chicken
egg.

"Alternative proteins have been extremely popular with investors this
year and we're pleased to be working with such an innovative company on
the cutting edge of that space," said Chris Rawley, CEO of Harvest
Returns. "We Are The New Farmers is producing a unique superfood that
will have increasing appeal to consumers."
