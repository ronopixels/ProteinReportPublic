Hjørring, Denmark, 23 August 2022 \-- On the 12th of August, Danish
food-tech company Aliga Microalgae purchased Duplaco's microalgae
production facility in the Netherlands in order to increase its
production capacity of Chlorella algae products for the food ingredients
and dietary supplement markets.

**The Facility**

Duplaco B.V. defaulted in June 2022 leaving one of Europe's most modern
microalgae production facilities behind. The facility, including IP and
customer stock, was purchased by Aliga Microalgae who is specialising in
cultivating, producing and commercialising algae ingredients. The
purchase is a part of Aliga's scaling strategy to increase the company's
production capacity and secure the supply-chain of its proprietary white
Chlorella ingredient, which will enable the company to meet the growing
demands from manufactures of animal-free, plant-based and analogue food
products globally. Additionally, the purchase will strengthen Aliga's
position as one of the leading producers of high-quality Chlorella algae
products for the European dietary supplement markets.

**The Product**

In July 2022 Aliga Microalgae is introduced its proprietary white
Chlorella algae ingredient to European markets - a sustainable
complement to soy and pea which can be applied in a broad variety of
analogue and hybrid food formulations. As an addition to its green
Chlorella offering, Aliga\'s white Chlorella is a chlorophyll-free,
white ingredient with neutral taste and flavour. The ingredient is
animal-free, plant-based, allergen-free and protein-rich making it
highly applicable in a broad variety of formulations, from meat &
seafood analogues and hybrids to savoury-, bakery- and plant-based dairy
products. This innovative ingredient is a non-GMO superfood that only
consists of fermented and dried Chlorella algae which naturally contains
vitamins, minerals, fibres, proteins, amino- and fatty acids. Its
improved organoleptic properties enables application in formulations
that previously has not been possible due green Chlorella's natural high
content of chlorophyll and strong algae flavour.

developing, producing and commercialising protein-rich and functional
Chlorella algae ingredients for food and supplement applications.
