NEW YORK, New York, June 27, 2023---Synonym, a New York-based developer
of biomanufacturing infrastructure, today publicly launched ScalerTM,
the first fully interactive, free, online tool enabling synthetic
biology companies to project their costs of production and operations at
commercial scale. 

With a straightforward, dynamic interface, Scaler allows any company
developing a bioproduct via fermentation to overcome one of the most
pressing challenges it faces: building and operating profitably at
commercial scale. After inputting just a few production variables, users
instantly receive a customized techno-economic analysis (TEA) with
insights into:

-   Projecting costs (CapEx, OpEx) to build and operate a facility at
    scale.
-   Identifying a bioproduct's biggest profitability drivers.
-   Understanding levers of commercial adoption.

At launch, Scaler is free to use and its model is updated often to
reflect changes to operating and capital costs. With Scaler's release,
companies will be able to find reliable, market-vetted data that can
jumpstart their capacity plans versus relying on a patchwork of
expensive, often unreliable data sources. 

"When we launched Synonym, it seemed obvious that the demand for
accessible biomanufacturing capacity far outstrips the supply," said
Synonym's co-founder and CEO Edward Shenderovich, "We need more
capacity, but we also need to get it done right. The data- and
software-first approach of Synonym's Scaler, offers a framework for the
industry to see biomanufacturing infrastructure as the transformational
asset class it is."

Scaler has already garnered praise from early adopters, including
founders of prominent synthetic biology companies and industry experts,
who emphasize its value in providing key insights into unit economics as
they scale.

The tool complements [Capacitor.bio](https://capacitor.bio/), the most
comprehensive, free directory of global fermentation capacity that
Synonym launched last fall. Together, Capacitor and Scaler provide the
synthetic biology ecosystem with a powerful, accessible suite of tools
to guide companies along their biomanufacturing scale up journey.
