mindfully crafted the Immunity+ Shots with the purpose of offering a
cravable and enjoyable way to naturally boost one's wellbeing. Moreover,
adding the Immunity+ Shots alongside our award-winning Core and Keto
wellness shake product lines, allows us to provide our consumers with
even more healthy beverage options," says Remedy Organics Founder and
Holistic Nutritionist, Cindy Kasindorf. "With the demand of consumers
looking for food and beverages with wholesome anti-viral and
immune-boosting properties, it was the perfect timing for our
