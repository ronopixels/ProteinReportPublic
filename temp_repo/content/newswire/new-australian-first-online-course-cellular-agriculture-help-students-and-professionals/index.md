Cellular Agriculture Australia (CAA), in collaboration with industry,
academia, and regulatory organisations, have created [Australia's first
online course](https://caa.learningx.com.au/) on cellular agriculture.
The course is specially designed for students and industry
professionals, to equip them with the foundational knowledge to
understand this emerging industry and its future potential. Knowledge
gained through the course will act as a baseline for practical
educational experiences, which is critical for future graduates to
translate theory into the creation of impactful outcomes for the sector.

The online course is the first of its kind in Australia, and was
developed in response from conversations with industry and academia, who
state that one of the biggest challenges the industry faces in order to
grow the sector and achieve commercial scale is the ability to access
and attract new talent. Globally, there is a growing risk of a talent
shortage, with predictions that more than [85 million jobs could go
unfilled](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/talent-crunch-future-of-work)
by 2030 due to the absence of skilled people to take them. Since the
cellular agriculture industry is still nascent, its future potential may
be hindered if initiatives to solve this problem are not explored and
actioned. This was the main driver for this initiative and CAA hopes it
will act as a catalyst for further dedicated courses that deepen
knowledge and build industry relevant skills for the sector.

The six modules consist of an introduction to cellular agriculture, an
opportunity for Australia, an introduction to cultivated meat
production, an introduction to precision fermentation, scaling cellular
agriculture, and food policy and regulation in Australia.

Students and industry professionals transitioning from other fields were
identified to be the key audience of the course which if successful,
could serve as a case study for universities to develop their own
internal subjects or courses on cellular agriculture, or could serve as
part of an employee\'s training at a cellular agriculture company. 

Christina Aguila, the University Innovation Specialist at GFI, said,
\"Cellular Agriculture Australia\'s short course is huge for the future
food movement. To feed nearly 10 billion people by 2050, we need to
prepare a massive wave of talent to enter the cellular agriculture
space.

Like any emerging field, we\'re facing a lack of formal educational
programs focused on cell ag and alternative proteins. It can take years
for universities to establish new courses and majors, so online short
courses like this are critical. Rather than wait for formal programs to
become commonplace at universities, CAA is giving learners an
opportunity to kickstart their educational journey into the alt protein
field right away.

Developing a robust alt protein workforce will require people from all
walks of life and parts of the world---not just students on the
traditional college path. This type of free, web-based offering is an
important step toward building the workforce required to feed the world
in a better way.\"

Although the world has transitioned to online learning, not all content
has been designed to deliver strong education outcomes. As such, and
through a collaborative approach, CAA intends to bring together subject
matter experts in all facets of cellular agriculture and learning and
development experts to create an accessible global learning hub for
cellular agriculture.

Dr. Sam Perkins, CEO of Cellular Agriculture Australia, says that, "When
online learning content is purposefully designed to create engaging
experiences and strong education outcomes it can act as a scalable tool
to support further practical and applied skill development, which will
be essential for the future of our sector."

[Cellular Agriculture
Australia](https://cellularagricultureaustralia.org/) is a nonprofit
organisation dedicated to accelerating the cellular agriculture sector
in Australia. Their initiatives are focused on developing talent
pipelines into cellular agriculture, creating a connected and
collaborative community within the sector, and promoting positive
awareness of cellular agriculture.
