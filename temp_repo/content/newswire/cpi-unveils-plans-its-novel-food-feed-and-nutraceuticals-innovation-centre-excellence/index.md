CPI, an independent technology innovation centre and founding member of
the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, today announced its plans to
establish a Novel Food, Feed and Nutraceuticals Innovation Centre of
Excellence, catalysed by £4 million in funding from the Tees Valley
Mayor and Combined Authority Cabinet.

By becoming the go-to place for process development and scale-up of
novel foods, feeds and nutraceuticals, this will help to drive both CPI
and the Tees Valley as leaders in biomanufacturing and food innovation.
The investment from the Tees Valley Combined Authority builds on recent
investments from CPI to create food grade precision fermentation and
pilot plant capabilities at the Wilton Centre in Redcar.

Increasing global demands for food, along with growing health,
environmental and animal welfare concerns are driving emerging trends in
the food, feed and nutraceutical markets. However, in order to keep up
with ever-changing consumer demands and drive innovation across the
product supply chain, specialised facilities, technical expertise and
advanced capabilities are needed.

To continue responding to this market need, CPI will extend its current
capabilities at the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility in
Wilton, Redcar with this funding, upgrading its laboratories and
technical development areas and establishing new food-grade
capabilities. This cutting-edge Centre of Excellence will enable CPI to
support businesses in developing new and improved food products,
ultimately creating new products and biomanufacturing jobs in the
region. The facility update will enable CPI to provide exemplar
services, samples and collaboration to recognised Food Safety and
Quality Standards (FSSC 22000).

The new Centre of Excellence will leverage at least an additional £20-30
million from industry over the next five years by attracting new
businesses to the Tees Valley; initially to work with CPI in the new
facilities, but hopefully in time to establish themselves in the region.

Through CPI's unique set of capabilities in the North East, the Centre
of Excellence will be able to integrate a variety of technologies from
ingredient production through to formulation and packaging solutions to
deliver the sustainable food supply chain demanded by consumers in the
21st Century. Within the innovation supply chain CPI will provide
connectivity, linking partners and collaborators from its global
network.

Frank Millar, CEO at CPI, said: "We are delighted to be building on
CPI's current capabilities in the food, feed and nutraceuticals market
through the development of this new Centre of Excellence. With this
investment from the Tees Valley Combined Authority, in conjunction with
CPI's investment programme and the commitment of industry partners, the
Novel Food, Feed and Nutraceuticals Innovation Centre of Excellence
places the Tees Valley at the heart of a more sustainable food
industry."

Kris Wadrop, General Manager for Biotechnology at CPI, said: "This
unique capability in Teesside will draw companies from all of the UK, EU
and even the world to Wilton. Ultimately, this new centre will enable
businesses to demonstrate technologies and develop products that could
transform our food, feed and nutraceuticals."
