**Paris - FRANCE, 12.09.2022. Nutropy, created by Nathalie Rolland and
Dr. Maya Bendifallah, two founders willing to propose a new sustainable
way to produce dairy products, raises €2M for the pilot production of
their animal-free cheese and milk ingredients. Supported by renowned
international food tech expert investors, the startup plans to launch
its first industrial production of animal-free premium cheese within the
next 24 months.**

The €2M pre-seed round was led by Beast, Big Idea Ventures (itself
supported by Bel Group, AAK, and others) and Trellis Road. "Beast is
super excited to partner with Nutropy on bringing premium animal-free
cheese to the world. We are particularly impressed with Nathalie and
Maya's innovative vision for scaling fermentation processes and their
dedication to producing innovative, impactful products. We are proud to
welcome them to the growing Beast family of climate deeptech companies",
says Patrick Schneider-Sikorsky, founder and managing partner at Beast.
The round was supported by VegCapital, FoodHack, Techmind (through
Jericho, its investors club dedicated to sustainable food), a few
international business angels with experience in technology, food
technology and agriculture and the French government.

Paris-based Nutropy has developed a new technology that gives
animal-free cheese products the texture and creaminess that people crave
in cheese. This is made possible by a protein called casein, which is
the first milk protein that Nutropy is producing through its technology.
"We've long been convinced of the critical role of casein in the shift
away from animal cheese products. After speaking to the majority of
casein startups globally we decided to invest in Nutropy as we were very
impressed with the team's technical ability and the milestones achieved
in such a short period of time", said Anna Ottosson, founding partner at
Trellis Road. Nutropy is also developing dairy fatty acids and has
carefully selected cheese cultures to produce real cheese flavors.

These innovations allow for the next generation of animal-free cheeses
that replicate the taste, texture and nutrition of animal cheese. \"We
are excited about Nutropy's technology and the quality of the products
the team has been able to produce. I tried their premium cheese at one
of our events, and the texture and taste were indistinguishable from
premium, animal-based cheese. Using bio-identical ingredients is a game
changer,\" says Andrew D. Ive, Founder and Managing General Partner of
Big Idea Ventures.

"As cheese lovers, we know the importance of cheese in our gastronomic
culture and want to offer consumers a wide range of cheeses free of
lactose and dietary cholesterol that are produced in an environmentally
friendly and sustainable manner", said Nathalie Rolland, CEO of Nutropy.
Nutropy's process has the potential to use significantly fewer natural
resources and limit the greenhouse gases and water pollution that
accompany animal-produced dairy products.

The international cheese market is worth \$200B and growing. Nutropy's
innovative approach, and its close collaboration with industrial cheese
producers and French cheese specialists, mean it is primed to lead the
development of a B2B "cheesable milk solution" producing many types of
cheese to expand the global cheese market to new frontiers.

**About Nutropy**

Nutropy is creating the next generation of animal-free dairy, starting
with cheese. The company was founded in Paris by Nathalie Rolland and

what we know and love in cheese - flavor, texture, melt - through a more

savoir-faire to create distinct animal-free dairy products, with a
