*Generation Investment Management and Breakthrough Energy Ventures
co-lead investment in alternative meat and dairy company*

CHICAGO, March 24, 2020 --- Nature's Fynd, a food tech company producing
a protein from a microbe originally discovered in the geothermal springs
of Yellowstone's ancient volcano, has raised \$80 million in
new funding.

The company was previously named Sustainable Bioproducts.

Production began this month at Nature's Fynd's new 35,000-square-foot
manufacturing facility on the site of the historic Union Stockyards in
Chicago's South Side. The company will commercialize food and beverage
products across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack occasions.

Nature's Fynd's revolutionary fermentation technology grows protein
using a fraction of the land and water resources required by
traditional agriculture.

The product contains all 9 essential amino acids, making it one of the
rare non-animal sources of complete protein. It also includes dietary
fiber, calcium, and vitamins. It is very versatile and can be made into
alternative meat and dairy products, as well as protein drinks
and powders.

"In these challenging times, securing food for our growing population
under the immense pressure of climate change becomes even more urgent,"
said CEO and co-founder Thomas Jonas. "We must find new solutions that
can both nourish people and nurture the planet. Our innovative
technology was developed by studying nature's own solutions for adapting
--- and ultimately thriving --- in environments with limited resources."

Generation Investment Management LLP, the dedicated sustainable
investment firm with \$25 billion assets under management as of Dec. 31,
2019, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a \$1 billion fund that invests
in companies combating climate change, both led the round.

Other participants include 1955 Capital; Mousse Partners; ADM Ventures,
the venture arm of ADM and Danone Manifesto Ventures, the venture arm of
global food and beverage company Danone.

"Nature's Fynd has a highly efficient solution to help address the
climate crisis," said Lila Preston, co-head of the Growth Equity
strategy at Generation Investment Management. "We have tracked the team
and technology for several years and believe this is one of the most
scalable platforms to drive true food system sustainability."

Added Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures: "As global
demand for protein increases, we urgently need new solutions that meet
our nutritional needs without further damaging the environment."

The company, which employs 50 people across its Chicago headquarters and
its Bozeman, Montana, R&D center, emerged out of NASA supported research
into organisms that thrive in the extreme environmental conditions of
Yellowstone National Park's geothermal springs. Those springs are part
of one of the world's largest active volcanoes.

Nature's Fynd plans to employ more than 100 people by the end of the
year. The company chose Chicago as its headquarters because of its
robust food industry, skilled workforce and
transportation infrastructure.
