CHICAGO, Ill. -- April 6, 2023 -- Food-tech startup [Aqua Cultured
Foods](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUQ3tKoGfuVes3hetCSGKdAtEzwo8TT9mTA1gsa98RLwbpQhf_Zd6hRd3O-2Bi7TiTmhDOob5tWqNe5lTPNe-2B65UQdIaIzmZQAnH6RxvvRANn1X6Z3IzwsCmbowZzueiMy3PRnFntlfiq1rgQTJcSgxCtniQoB9bgniRRFnIRCzy-2B4wS2fleT0j7Y55pzXeKc9-2Bl8Ed-2BAx5OHGktlpoX0vEj6W6j7ZE1MB65wE9DDDkEozvOI72BruRujJ-2B3I-2FdxL2sXtqgSL-2FGNwx1XkGnIZhyBzxRmNwmq3bW2HzWHSNun-2B9lF0B-2FoCD8fXii-2FNu8ckj-2BImNxeO0qCE3EvlLnTZE0SmkEBBDfwfd-2FTvyvFPVnnIVQ7ll2Q1b7hpdVeVZLvU5qNsldJ5qzt7EY4772MR-2BBcdAKef1g-3D)
today announced it has raised \$5.5 million in seed funding to bring its
ultra-realistic seafood alternatives to market.

The round was led by [Stray Dog Capital](https://straydogcapital.com/),
a venture capital fund specializing in alternative protein investments,
with participation from [H Venture Partners](https://h.ventures/),
[Aztec Capital Management](https://www.azteccapitalmanagement.com/) and
[Amplifica Capital](https://www.amplifica.capital/), along with
follow-on investment from current investors [Supply Change
Capital](https://supplychange.fund/), [Big Idea
Ventures](https://bigideaventures.com/), [HPA](https://hpa.vc/), [Aera
VC](https://www.aera.vc/), [Kingfisher Family
Investments](https://www.kingfishercapital.com/), and [Swiss
Pampa](https://www.swisspampa.com/). The round also included a strategic
investment from [CJ CheilJedang](https://www.cj.co.kr/en/index), a South
Korea-based global food and bio company owning renowned brands such as
Bibigo.

Aqua will use the investment to equip its new facility, scale up
production, bring products to market, add key talent, and expand its
roster of restaurant and foodservice outlets for product introductions
this year.

"We appreciate having mission-aligned partners that offer strong
strategic value for the next phase of our growth, which will involve
building up the business and brand," said Anne Palermo, CEO of Aqua.
"Being good stewards of investor capital is important to us, so along
with hitting milestones earlier than expected, we are benefiting from
government programs, academic resources, and other advantages to get to
market quickly."

Aqua's primary value is its low cost of scaling and its path to price
parity, thanks to proprietary fermentation methods that use relatively
affordable inputs and equipment. The company recently acquired a
food-grade facility that was already built out nearly to its
requirements---which it estimates will save more than a million dollars
in construction costs.

Aqua was recently accepted into the Illinois Office of Business
Development's EDGE program that provides tax incentives to growing
companies, which will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes
over the next 10 years.

"The adage is true that early-stage funds heavily weight investment
conviction in people, and less in technologies or products given the
embryonic nature of companies at these stages, but Aqua already boasts
strength across its team, product, and key partnerships already in
place," said Johnny Ream, Partner at Stray Dog Capital. "We are
interested in backing founding teams leveraging unique technologies and
approaches that drive a more sustainable future; the work Aqua is doing
with alt-seafood has immense potential to drive both human and planetary
benefits in a massive \$100B+ global market."

The global plant-based seafood market was valued at \$42.1 million in
2021, and is [projected to reach \$1.3
billion](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/plant-based-seafood-market-A17387)
by 2031 with a CAGR of more than 42 percent as wild fish stocks are
further depleted. In addition to depleted fish populations, commercial
fishing practices result in damage to ecosystems, plastic waste, and
"bycatch" of non-target species. As fish farming increases, so does
habitat destruction, pollution and diseases spread to wild fish, and the
industry's reliance on antibiotics and wild-caught fish for feed.

Despite its health halo, fish contains microplastics, mercury,
pesticides, antibiotics, dioxin and PCBs. High in cholesterol and
saturated fats, seafood, in particular finfish, is a good source of
foodborne illness caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.

Aqua is developing calamari, shrimp, scallops, and filets of tuna and
whitefish with proprietary mycoprotein fermentation processes that do
not use any animal inputs, genetic altering or modification. Unlike
plant-based processed foods formulated with starches and protein
isolates, Aqua's alt-seafood retains its naturally occurring fiber,
protein, and other micronutrients. The company also produces minced
"seafood" fillings for applications such as dumplings, ravioli, and
sushi rolls.
