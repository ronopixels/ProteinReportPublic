*Arkeon Biotechnologies, a Vienna-based ingredients startup setting out
to create the most sustainable, nutritious, and ethical food system
through gas fermentation and ancient microbes, secures more than US\$7
million in an oversubscribed seed round.*

**Vienna, Austria, March 7, 2022** \-- Vienna-based ingredients startup
Arkeon Biotechnologies has closed its seed financing at more than 7
million US Dollars in an oversubscribed funding round. Arkeon is the
first company in the world to leverage the technology of gas
fermentation with the power of archaea, an ancient microorganism with
unique properties, for food applications. The company's proprietary
technology produces all 20 amino acids for the human diet in one
production step.

On a mission to create the most sustainable, nutritious, and ethical
food system, Arkeon uses highly efficient microorganisms -- archaea --
to produce functional and customizable protein ingredients. With a
technology that is fully independent from agricultural land and with the
ability to directly convert CO2 into food ingredients, the company holds
the key to unlocking a food system without resource constraints, without
geographical restrictions, and free from animal suffering.

Leading food and climate investors including Synthesis Capital and ReGen
Ventures participated in the investment round. The capital raised will
be allocated towards scaling up production levels, process engineering,
and product development.

The founding of Arkeon was supported by the Berlin-based company builder
EVIG, which specializes in working with scientists to build
biotechnology startups in the food sector.

"We are proud to partner with experienced investors who strongly believe
in our vision to produce the next generation of protein ingredients just
from CO2" explained Dr. Gregor Tegl, Co-Founder and Managing Director of
Arkeon Biotechnologies.

**The wonders of Archaea -- an underexplored microorganism holding
unique potential**

Archaea are one of the most ancient microorganisms in the world and are
intertwined with the creation of life on earth. They are exceptional in
their capabilities and evolved to thrive in extreme environments like
underwater volcanoes.

Whilst these microbes are still an underutilized and underexplored
lifeform, Arkeon's proprietary technology holds the key to unlocking
their potential: The company's science team comprises the world's
leading Archaea technologists led by Simon Rittmann, Arkeon's CSO,
renowned in the scientific community for pioneering the biotechnology
process for archaea and his dedicated research on the microorganisms
over the last decade.

**Enabling a fundamental shift away from current industrial agriculture
practices**

Compared to modern agriculture, which relies on lengthy processes
involving many steps such as growing, harvesting, and purifying, Arkeon
offers an incredibly efficient shortcut: A single step is needed to
produce the desired ingredients. In doing so, the company effectively
bypasses traditional agriculture, allowing for food production without
crop dependencies.

Since more CO2 is consumed than produced during the gas fermentation
process, Arkeon's products will be carbon-negative. "For the first time
in history, we can turn the equation of modern food production upside
down and turn a resource-intensive industry into a sustainable,
low-emission system", says Dr. Gregor Tegl.

**Creating nutritious, functional, and delicious food -- molecule by
molecule**

Arkeon's proprietary technology converts CO2 directly into an entire
range of all 20 amino acids -- all of which are essential for the human
diet -- as well as functional peptides that will bring a variety of
high-value ingredients to customers. The company can produce different
compositions of aminos which further allow to generate various protein
ingredients of varying nutritional and functional profiles.

Arkeon's customizable products are 100% vegan-friendly, GMO-free, and
can be used as clean label ingredients for plant-based foods, nutrition
products, beverages, cultivated meat cell culture media, and much more.

**About** **Arkeon GmbH (Arkeon Biotechnologies)**

Arkeon Biotechnologies is an ingredients company based in Vienna,
Austria leveraging the power of ancient microbes to create the most
sustainable, nutritious and ethical food system possible. The company's
technological foundations have been built up over a decade of research
by co-founders Dr. Simon Rittmann, Dr. Guenther Bochmann, and Dr. Gregor
Tegl. Arkeon's proprietary technology leverages archaea microorganisms
that naturally produce all the building blocks of proteins in only one
fermentation. The company's process converts CO2 directly into amino
acids and functional peptides for the food industry, enabling an
entirely new world of food products. With a team that comprises
world-leading Archaea biologists, process engineers, food scientists and
fermentation technologists, the company is on a mission to change food
production on a global scale. More information at
