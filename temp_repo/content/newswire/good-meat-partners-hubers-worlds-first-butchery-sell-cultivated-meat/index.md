SINGAPORE (December 8, 2022) -- [GOOD
Meat](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoodmeat.co&esheet=52963069&newsitemid=20221107006023&lan=en-US&anchor=GOOD+Meat&index=1&md5=7e2cb1788f9f101e02cc64ce2d66f157),
the cultivated meat division of food technology company Eat Just, Inc.,
announced today that [Huber's Butchery](https://www.hubers.com.sg/), one
of Singapore's premier producers and suppliers of high-quality meat
products, will become the first butchery in the world to sell and serve
cultivated meat. With the introduction of the latest version of GOOD
Meat's cultivated chicken, the family-owned and operated business is
thrilled to add a new, locally produced offering to its display case and
bistro menu.

Beginning today through Saturday, Dec. 10, invited guests will get an
early taste of the cultivated chicken dishes that will be available
weekly starting in January for in-restaurant dining by reservation,
while supplies last. The special preview coincides with the second
anniversary of GOOD Meat's [historic
launch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201220005063/en/Eat-Just-Makes-History-Again-with-Restaurant-Debut-of-Cultured-Meat) in
Singapore and follows last month's United Nations Climate Change
Conference in Egypt where the company's chicken was [enjoyed by global
climate
leaders](https://www.goodmeat.co/all-news/good-meat-cultivated-meat-on-cop27-menu),
media and members of civil society for the first time outside of
Singapore.

"Offering this new approach to making meat at a butchery is another
historic moment in the long road to making our food system more
delicious and sustainable. I'm very proud to partner with the Huber's
team to give people a whole new way to experience our cultivated chicken
in the new year,\" said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just.

"When we founded our butcher shop, we made it our mission to provide top
quality and exceptional tasting meat products with the highest food
safety standards at an affordable price. Partnering with GOOD Meat is in
keeping with that vision and the realities of our ever-changing food
system," said Huber's Butchery Managing Director Ryan Huber. "Cultivated
meat could be one of the solutions to over-farming due to increased
population size and density and an increase in animal protein
consumption in many parts of the world," added Executive Director Andre
Huber.

GOOD Meat's partnership with Huber's is the latest in a series of
exciting announcements for the company. GOOD Meat won regulatory
approvals for its chicken in Singapore in November 2020 and December
2021. It remains the only cultivated meat producer in the world with the
ability to sell to consumers. Since launch, the company's chicken has
been featured on menus at local fine dining establishments, roadside
hawker stalls and via foodpanda, Asia\'s leading food and grocery
delivery platform.
