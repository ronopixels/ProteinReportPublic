*Yogurt Project to Serve as Concept Product for Use of Cultured Milk
Ingredients in Food Products, Reducing Global Reliance on Animal-Based
Milk Production*

REHOVOT, Israel -- July 6, 2022
-- [Wilk](https://wilkismilk.com/) (TASE: WILK), a developer of
authentic, cell-cultured human and animal milk and milk components, has
announced the launch of a new project to develop the first yogurt using
cell-cultured milk fat. In its first stage, the product will be used as
a concept product.

The yogurt will be the first food product to incorporate a cell-cultured
milk ingredient and serve as proof of the viability of Wilk's cell-based
technology for minimizing the need to use animals in future dairy
production. The product will contain the core component of fat cultured
from cells, ensuring that it retains the inherent nutritional benefits
only found in real milk fats, including the full complement of essential
macro and micronutrients.

"It has long been established that milk fat is integral to supporting
human health and nutrition, aiding the absorption of key nutrients, such
as vitamins D and E and calcium, into the blood while providing a rich
source of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic
properties," said Tomer Aizen, CEO of Wilk. "These core properties
cannot be replicated through alternative technologies, making Wilk the
first company in the world to develop a dairy product containing
genuine, cell-cultured milk fat. We will continue investing our efforts
and resources to develop cell-cultured milk and breast milk components
that will help our partners produce healthier products in a more
sustainable manner."

The project is expected to last approximately six months, culminating in
the incorporation of cell-cultured animal milk fat into the product.
Concurrently, Wilk is working to increase the production capacity of
cell-cultured fat in its facilities and establish optimal fat separation
methods for use in foods.

In tandem with its advances in developing cell-cultured animal milk fats
for dairy products, Wilk is working to accelerate the production of
cultured human milk components that will be integrated into infant
formula to develop products that are optimized for infants' growth and
development.
