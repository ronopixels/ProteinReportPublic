More than 100 entries were received from start-ups around the world,
answering CPF's call for innovative alternative-protein enhancements and
Cargill's search for digital production chain solutions. After an
in-depth review and judging process, the teams at CPF and Cargill each
selected three finalists to pitch their technologies to their judging
panel and the global Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit audience
of more than 900 agri-food leaders.

**CPF's winner, LYPID,** brings luscious texture, lip-smacking
mouthfeel, long-lasting flavour and juiciness to plant based meat.
Plant-based oils have different textures, melting points, water content,
and flavours than animal fats. Lypid is creating a line of fats made
from plant-based oils that can be tuned to precise textures and melting
points.

**Cargill's winner, CONNECTING FOOD,** harnesses blockchain technology
to improve food security, reduce wastage and reinforce consumer trust in
our food systems. Connecting Food leverages industry expertise to map
food supply chains, improve end-to-end traceability and showcase value
chain data via a QR code and WebApp, bringing trust through transparency
to consumers.

Revealing the winner of the Innovation Challenge at the Asia-Pacific
Agri-Food Innovation Summit in Singapore were judges from CPF and

Commenting on the reasons for the winning choice, Lalana Thiranusornkij,
SVP -- Head of Innovation & NPD at CPF said: *"All three of our
finalists are truly amazing, full of passion and energy in addressing
the taste and texture of alternative-protein products and this is the
most important issue for companies to be able to deliver to their
consumers. What was even more difficult was to select the winner! I'm
proud to announce the winner being "Lypid". A start-up that addresses
"Fat" which is key to making plant based meats taste like meat! We feel
that working with Lypid will speed up our development and improve our
existing products to be even healthier and tastier."*

Dr. Colin D'Silva, Vice President, Government Relations, Asia-Pacific at
Cargill said *"We are impressed by the strong response from highly
innovative start-ups to the Cargill Innovation Challenge. We

the world in a safe, responsible and sustainable way. The blockchain
technology developed by Connecting Food will help improve food security,
reduce wastage and reinforce consumer trust in our food systems through
greater supply chain transparency and end-to-end traceability."*

Ellen McLeay, Senior Conference Producer at The Asia-Pacific Agri-Food
Innovation Summit said: *"We've been blown away by the applications and
finalist presentations, showcasing incredible innovation and talent that
will help to strengthen the food system in APAC and beyond. Thanks to
the CPF and Cargill judging teams for their invaluable time, insights
and commitment to supporting start-ups in their growth. Congratulations
to the winners - we can't wait to watch them grow, and hear plenty more

agreed areas, and the chance to do Proof of Concept and work with CPF's
