Pulp Culture, the acclaimed better-for-you bev-alc innovator, today
announces an expansion of its category-defining lineup with the release
of "BUILD," the world's first protein-boosted hard juice. A super
beverage developed with leading alternative protein player The EVERY Co.
("EVERY"), BUILD (SRP \$16.99/4 pack) is the first release in the new
hyper-functional Pulp Culture+ line, now nationally available online
while supplies last, with brick and mortar retail roll-out to follow.

BUILD by Pulp Culture+ represents a breakthrough in functional
beverages: a protein-boosted, Full Spectrum alcoholic beverage that
actually tastes good. The unprecedented partnership behind this
world's-first beverage celebrates the union of the time-honored art of
fermentation with a next-gen spin: while Pulp Culture uses spontaneous
fermentation to brew better alcoholic beverages, EVERY is fermenting
real animal proteins without animals, leveraging flavor science and
technology to make protein consumption more fun, accessible and
delicious--with lower impact.

BOOSTED JUICE\
"BUILD is something that I\'ve wished existed for years: highly
bioavailable, nature-equivalent and quality animal protein---without the
animal---in a wild-fermented, naturally alcoholic, zero-sugar probiotic
beverage with botanical adaptogens," said Brendan Brazier, former
Ironman triathlete and Pulp Culture co-founder. "We know people,
especially fitness enthusiasts, want the positive outcomes of a better
beverage that naturally contains alcohol---and it's finally here."

Until now, protein addition was beyond reach for Pulp Culture, which
previously struggled to identify a protein that possessed the
solubility, texture and neutral taste profile suitable for the brand's
premium live-culture beverages. EVERY Protein's superior performance
among leading soluble proteins finally unlocked this super beverage from
Pulp Culture, which required zero masking agents, sugar or other
unnecessary additives to create its first-to-market, protein-boosted
hard juice.

In addition to its novel protein boost thanks to animal-free EVERY
Protein, BUILD includes Pulp Culture's unique combination of functional
superfoods, super fruits, super mushrooms and probiotics to deliver a
premium functional beverage experience tailor-made for active
lifestyles. Cordyceps are the powerhouse functional mushrooms in the
beverage, and adaptogenic ashwagandha, pineapple, coconut and vanilla
round out the ingredients. BUILD contains zero sugar and zero
cholesterol, and more than 6 billion CFUs of naturally occurring
probiotics.

Converging consumer trends point to growing interest in better-than-ever
beverages, with functional, digestive and adaptogenic claims in
beverages on the rise. Simultaneously, protein addition has skyrocketed
as an area of interest in drinks, as consumers continue to ask more of
their products, including around complementarity for active lifestyles.
Enabling protein addition in BUILD--effectively unlocking this
world's-first super beverage--EVERY Protein is made by precision
fermentation, a technique driving today's most exciting alternative
proteins and representing a market projected to reach USD 36.3 billion
by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 48.1% in terms of value.

BUILD by Pulp Culture+ unites these broader trends with the explosive
Hard Alternatives category, up more than 2,000 percent in Drizly in a
recent period --paving the way for a bright future for better beverages
with manifold benefits, like BUILD.

FERMENTING THE FUTURE\
"The EVERY Co. has helped us unlock the potential of protein addition in
our fermented hard juice--something that previously seemed unthinkable
with existing soluble proteins on the market," noted Mark McTavish,
co-founder of Pulp Culture. "Combining the best of both of our worlds
laid the foundation for a beverage that initially seemed impossible to
make--yet here it is, thanks to the transformational quality of
animal-free EVERY Protein, and our own signature wild ferments--now made
more awesome still thanks to this boost from the drink tech space."

BUILDING BETTER BEVERAGES\
"We're incredibly excited to partner with Pulp Culture, a brand that
continues to push boundaries to create new offerings for a cult
following of beverage enthusiasts," said Arturo Elizondo, co-founder and
CEO of The EVERY Company. "This is a watershed moment for The EVERY
Company, as we bring our novel animal-free animal protein to better
bev-alc to deliver the bullseye of what today's consumers want. Move
over superfoods: super bevs have arrived."
