-   Provenance Bio has produced animal-free gelatin from recombinant
    full-length, bovine type I collagen, produced in their proprietary
    protein expression platform.

-   The company has developed a proprietary protein expression platform
    to make biomimetic proteins that can beat animal agriculture prices.

-   Provenance Bio is exploring partnerships with multiple global
    companies that are industry leaders in pharmaceuticals,
    biomaterials, and foods.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 23, 2021 - Provenance Bio, a San Francisco-based
alternative proteins company, announced today that it has made
animal-free gelatin using their proprietary protein expression platform.

The gelatin made by Provenance is designed to be identical to
traditionally-sourced animal gelatin, while using no animal inputs.

Traditionally, gelatin is made from collagens extracted from cow or pig
hides and bones. Gelatin is used in a wide array of consumer goods such
as in capsules for vitamins and therapeutics, as an ingredient in foods
for imparting texture, and as a key component used in tissue
engineering.

Provenance Bio is focused on producing animal-free gelatin to address
issues in the market such as inconsistencies in quality and to make
products devoid of contaminants. Provenance Bio also makes its gelatin
from collagen, which is produced in their microbial platform. For its
recombinant gelatin products, Provenance currently uses full-length,
type I collagen, the most abundant form of collagen in mammals but
produced in a clean laboratory setting. Provenance gelatins promise to
have the same functional attributes as those derived from animal
collagens but with a radically reduced environmental footprint.

"Gelatin represents a large and growing market. We were inspired to make
an animal-free gelatin to provide a sustainable and humane solution for
this material, while solving major concerns with animal derived gelatins
that suffer from animal-borne illness, batch-to-batch variability, and
price fluctuations. Provenance collagens, which are entirely
animal-free, also support the growing demand for vegan alternatives to
gelatin products with superior performance," says Provenance Bio CEO,
Michalyn Andrews.

In addition to full length bovine collagens, Provenance is utilizing a
library of collagen variants for tailored applications.

"We are excited about all the possible industrial applications of
Provenance gelatins, as well as other proteins. The platform will
produce animal-free gelatin at attractive price points. When we began
our work at Provenance, there was no way to make the proteins we needed
at scale," she says. "We took it upon ourselves to redesign a new
chassis for protein production that would revolutionize our ability to
deliver functional proteins at price parity with those sourced from
animals. While we still have a road ahead of us, to date, we've been
able to increase our own collagen strain efficiencies by 100x."

Recombinant collagen, as a sustainable solution for animal products has
been out of reach to date due to the historic challenge of producing
these functional proteins. Access to biomimetic collagens with zero
animal inputs, at price parity with current animal products, will enable
its wider adoption across all relevant sectors.

Andrews continues, "Gelatin is just the first of many animal products
we're disrupting at Provenance. Full-length proteins are important for
the markets we're working to disrupt. We want our gelatin to be a
seamless plug-and-play product for corporations ready to make their
supply chains more sustainable. Today our collagen products have 1/50th
the carbon footprint of bovine collagen products. By year end, we expect
to cut that number by 90 percent, making our products over 500 times
more carbon efficient than collagens and related products sourced from
cattle."

By partnering with large corporations for product rollout, Provenance
intends to move quickly as an impact-focused organization, furthering
the mission of transitioning large global supply chains for sustainable
solutions.
