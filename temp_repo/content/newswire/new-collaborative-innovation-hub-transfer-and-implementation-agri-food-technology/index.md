-   A project promoted by CNTA (the Spanish National Centre for Food
    Technology and Safety) with the support of the Government of Navarra
    and collaboration of more than 10 R&D&I centers of the Navarre R&D&I
    System (SINAI)
-   Among the activities that will be developed in the hub there is the
    detection of needs between the stakeholders of the sector and the
    generation of new opportunities; developing, validating, and
    demonstrating solutions and accompanying in the scaling and the
    implementation of these solutions

**Madrid, November 30th** --- **CNTA** (National Center for Food
Technology and Safety) has created **the Eatex Food Innovation Hub**,
the new collaborative innovation hub for the transfer and implementation
of technology in the agri-food industry. As an ecosystem of open and
applied innovation, Eatex Food Innovation Hub addresses and solves
today\'s and future problems in the agri-food sector through a holistic
focus based on the implementation of agile and advanced dynamics and
research models.

Innovation in the agri-food sector is unstoppable. In 2021 the Spanish
national Foodtech ecosystem tripled its investments compared to last
year, according to accelerator Eatable Adventure's data, achieving
excellent traction from national and international investors, managing
to position Spain as the fifth European power in this vertical. This
boom in innovation and solidity in intellectual property has boosted the
creation of new models of collaboration between the principal agents of
this ecosystem to accelerate the technology transfer.

**Eatex Food Innovation Hub** was born as a gathering point,  a space
beyond a physical location, where science and businesses collaborate to
make research and technology transfer successful. This project promoted
by **CNTA** has the support of the **Government of Navarre** and the
collaboration of more than 10  R&D&I centers of the Navarre R&D&I System
(**SINAI**). The creation of this hub is part of the Complementary Plan
**AGROALNEXT**, within the Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience plan
financed by the European Union - **NextGenerationEU**.

Among its objectives is to **improve** and **accelerate** the technology
transfer of valuable solutions from the R&D centers to the agri-food
sector to increase the success rate of technology transfer and reduce
the innovation risk. According to **Silvia García de la Torre**, Eatex
Food Innovation Hub director, *"the motivation to create this new hub
comes from improving technology transfer, a very important tool with
great potential for agri-food companies since it will allow them to open
to new possibilities, ideas, and opportunities."*

This will be achieved through the implementation of agile and advanced
research dynamics and models, based on collaboration and co-creation of
solutions with a holistic vision of the entire value chain and with a
focus on the final customer.  In addition, providing funding for the
development of solutions with agile management of projects oriented
towards results and collaborating and creating synergies with other
entities and initiatives.

Among the activities that will be developed in the hub, there will be
the detection of needs in the sector and the generation of new
opportunities; developing, validating, and demonstrating solutions while
accompanying the scale and implementation of those solutions.

Eatex Food Innovation Hub will start its activity in mid-December with
the ¨**Program for the development of innovation and technology
transfer**" where it will address six research areas: promotion of
agriculture and livestock of the future, search for new ingredients and
production models, development of new food and beverage for healthy
eating, implementation of the industry 4.0 and hyperconnected processes,
innovation applied to food packaging and preservation systems and the
application of circularity and appraisal of by-products and waste.
