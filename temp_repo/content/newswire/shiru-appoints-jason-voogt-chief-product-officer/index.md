*The ingredient veteran will bring continued commercial focus and
Shiru's first products to market*

-   **Voogt built Shiru's early product pipeline in gelation, egg
    replacement, and alternative fats.**
-   **Voogt has an impressive track record in bringing tech-enabled
    products to market with companies such as Ferrero and Amyris.**
-   **The move signals Shiru's commercial maturity as it readies for its
    first product launch in 2023.**

Tuesday, Nov 8, 2022 (Alameda, CA) - Shiru, a functional ingredients
discovery company, has promoted Jason Voogt to the role of Chief Product
Officer. In his expanded role, Voogt will lead the commercialization of
Shiru's product portfolio, beginning with its first product launch in
2023. He will also lead product vision, strategy, and execution to
deliver uniquely capable ingredients to global food companies.

Voogt joined Shiru as VP of Product in August 2021, after years of
successfully converting early-stage technology into tangible products
across food, agriculture, specialty chemicals, and personal care. Before
Shiru, he led the innovation team at Italian confectioner Ferrero to
identify and develop early ingredients. At Amyris, he successfully
scaled-up and launched the synthetic biotech company's first commercial
product, squalane.Â 

"Jason's promotion to Chief Product Officer is an important moment for
Shiru, symbolizing both his leadership and our commercial maturity as we
near our first product launch," said Jasmin Hume, Shiru Founder and CEO.
"Jason's a great example of a teammate who has not only played a
tremendous role in developing our products and business but he also
embodies Shiru's values, including executing for impact and innovating
with integrity."

"It's been thrilling to lead the growth and development of the Shiru
product team, and I'm proud of our early product pipeline of ingredients
for gelation, egg replacement, and alternative fats," said Voogt. "I am
confident that we can continue to align Shiru's technical capabilities
with the needs of the food industry to create incredible new ingredients
and products."

Voogt's promotion is the latest commercial development at Shiru,
including recently announced partnerships with global food leaders
Puratos and CP Kelco. Shiru also recently announced that Impossible
Foods veteran Ranjani Varadan joined as Chief Scientific Officer, as
well as three industry-leading advisors, including Dean Banks, former
Tyson CEO.
