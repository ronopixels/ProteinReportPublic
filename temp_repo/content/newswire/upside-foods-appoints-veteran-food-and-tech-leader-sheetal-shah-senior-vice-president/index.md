Berkeley, California, June 8, 2022 --- [UPSIDE
Foods](https://upsidefoods.com/), the leading company in the cultivated
meat, poultry and seafood industry, has announced the appointment of
Sheetal Shah as Senior Vice President of Supply Chain and Manufacturing.
This news comes on the heels of UPSIDE announcing its record-breaking
[\$400 million Series C
round](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/upside-foods-raises-a-400m-series-c-round-to-commercialize-cultivated-meat-at-scale-301529998.html)
that enables the company to unlock the industry's biggest opportunities
around scale, supply chain, and consumer adoption.

Shah is joining UPSIDE as the company approaches commercialization and
scales production. He will lead the development of UPSIDE's supply chain
and strategic sourcing for cell feed and other critical inputs that will
reduce costs and enable scale. Shah will also oversee UPSIDE's
production facilities -- including its existing Engineering, Production
and Innovation Center (EPIC) and future larger-scale commercial
facilities -- and quality functions.

Prior to UPSIDE Foods, Shah served as Senior Vice President of Product &
Operations at Impossible Foods, where he managed the supply chain
through a period of global turbulence during the COVID-19 pandemic,
expanded the product portfolio, enabled retail expansion globally and
unlocked manufacturing capacity. He was also formerly the Chief
Operations Officer at Verifone, where he managed global supply chains
through periods of hypergrowth. Before that, Shah was the Chief
Procurement Officer at Google's Motorola division, where he was
responsible for end-to-end global supplier management. Shah started his
career at Motorola as a DSP software engineer and holds multiple patents
in the areas of speech recognition and audio processing. 

"Sheetal has everything it takes to be an UPSIDER: a deep commitment to
making our favorite foods a force for good, a proven track record of
solving seemingly intractable challenges and a passion for human health,
animal welfare and the environment," said Dr. Uma Valeti, CEO and
Founder of UPSIDE Foods. "I am thrilled to welcome Sheetal to the team
as we unlock some of the most critical opportunities for the cultivated
meat industry."

UPSIDE Foods recently announced the close of a [\$400 million Series
C](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/upside-foods-raises-a-400m-series-c-round-to-commercialize-cultivated-meat-at-scale-301529998.html)
funding round, the largest in the industry to date, placing its
valuation at over \$1 billion. The funding enables UPSIDE to build its
commercial-scale facility, develop the supply chain for cell feed and
other inputs and invest in consumer education. It will also be used to
commercialize UPSIDE's first product -- real chicken, grown directly
from animal cells -- pending regulatory review.

"I'm absolutely thrilled to be joining UPSIDE Foods at such an exciting
inflection point. Cultivated meat will transform our food system for the
better, and UPSIDE is the clear industry leader," said Sheetal Shah.
"Developing a reliable supply chain for making cultivated meat at scale
is one of the greatest opportunities for the planet."

Over the past year, the company has rebranded from Memphis Meats to
UPSIDE Foods, announced chicken as its first consumer product, partnered
with three-Michelin starred chef Dominique Crenn, developed a cell feed
that\'s completely free of animal components, acquired cultivated
seafood company Cultured Decadence, and opened its Engineering,
Production and Innovation Center (EPIC)---the most advanced production
facility and innovation center for cultivated meat in the world.
