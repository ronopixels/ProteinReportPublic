SINGAPORE - [Big Idea Ventures](https://bigideaventures.com/) and [Grand
Hyatt
Singapore](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/singapore/grand-hyatt-singapore/sinrs?src=adm_sem_agn_pfx_corp_apac_other_PFX_Search_Google_ASPAC_ASPAC_SINRS_BR_Hyatt_SG_EN_SINRS_BR_Exact_Rooms_SG_EN_Grand+Hyatt+Singapore&gclid=CjwKCAjwnPOEBhA0EiwA609ReUZF5_8asno-EUcZIep6HGfYjc41qmlFy_MuepnNYZFD7-DfV0ULmBoCQT0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
held its first in-person and virtual tasting from the latest plant-based
companies at the end of last month -- [*Tasting Big Ideas
2021*](https://tastingbigideas.com/). This was the third Big Idea
Ventures tasting event showcasing alternative protein innovations, but
the first time offering both in-person and virtual tasting experiences.
The event showcased the World's next generation of alternative protein
companies.

*"Changes in global consumer demand, sustainability and food security is
driving significant growth in alternative protein food innovation.
Startups are fast developing alternatives to meat, dairy and seafood. We
are now able to deliver a high culinary experience while delivering on
these global and personal health benefits,\"* said **Andrew D. Ive,
Founder and Managing General Partner of** Big Idea Ventures. Big Idea
ventures is a venture capital fund with startup accelerators in key
locations, investing in and accelerating top performers in the new food
space. Its first fund, the New Protein Fund, has raised over USD\$50
million to invest in the best companies in the alternative protein
ecosystem.

*"With the New Protein Fund, we will support some of the best companies
globally developing meat, seafood and dairy alternatives to support the
ecosystem driving big changes in the food industry,"* added Christian
Cadeo, Managing Partner of Big Idea Ventures in Asia.

Chefs at Grand Hyatt created the culinary tasting experience for
attendees of the event. Chef Lucas of Grand Hyatt said: *"Working with
these plant-based products, it is a great opportunity to share with
like-minded guests who care deeply for our food - where the ingredients
come from and how it is being produced."*

*"It was like a black box competition, you receive the products, it all
comes in boxes, you open and see - wow these are the products, then we
think what we can create with that",* said Chef Gottfried.

*Top trends to come out of the Tasting Event:*

1.  Fermentation drives more options for alternative protein

Fermentation can develop everything from seafood and sustainable oils,
and innovations will rise in these areas in 2021.

The development of new alternative solutions that are entering the
market will go some way to replacing their traditional products.
Examples of such companies developing products are [Aquacultured
Foods](https://www.aquaculturedfoods.com/), the first whole muscle
seafood alternative created through microbial fermentation and
[Farmsow](https://farmsow.com/), with its patent-pending microbial
fermentation process delivers sustainable alternatives to tropical oils
and animal fats for diverse applications..

2.  Alternative protein dine-in and take-out options growing

Plant-based options have thrived despite the pandemic, and many products
have launched throughout the world. [Angie\'s Tempeh,
founded](https://angiestempeh.com/) during the pandemic, is now
available at Vios by [Blu Kouzina](https://blukouzina.com/) and [Little
Farms](https://littlefarms.com/) Groceries.

To celebrate the diversity of plant-based foods and to deliver to
multicultural tastes, [Plant Ranch
Foods](https://www.plantranchfoods.com/), from the US produces the only
full line of plant-based Mexican flavored proteins based on
generations-old family recipes and [Haofood\'s](https://www.haofood.co/)
from China developed the first peanut protein based chicken, available
at various restaurants in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with many applications
from Asian to Western food. Also, in light of the pandemic, *Tasting Big
Ideas 2021* and 2020 offered a virtual tasting option where guests could
opt to have a tasting kit delivered to enjoy in the comfort of their
homes or offices.

3.  Improving Taste and Texture for Alternative Protein

As more consumers adopt a plant-based diet, we need plant-based foods to
have not only the right taste, smell and price but also the right
texture and mouthfeel. Increasingly we will see technologies and
companies such as [Meat. The End](https://www.meattheend.tech/) which
will allow plant-based foods to be indistinguishable from the
traditional meats they can and will replace.

4.  Cell-based products futuristic concept overseas but a growing trend
    in Singapore

Singapore was the first country in the world to give approval to the
commercialisation of cell-based meat. In late 2020 the Singapore Food
Agency gave approval to [Eat
Just](https://www.ju.st/stories/plant-based-eggs?gclid=CjwKCAjwnPOEBhA0EiwA609ReamrQAXZqoZXUdOvGayU1gc-6kNKU-S0D4G7b5sK3foeRQLF97gdkhoCIDcQAvD_BwE)
to sell cultured chicken to customers.

Companies from Big Idea Ventures' portfolio company, [Animal Alternative
Technologies](https://www.animalalternativetechnologies.com/) and
[Innocent Meat](https://www.innocent-meat.com/) foresee this trend and
provide end-to-end solutions to scale production of cell-based meat in a
cost efficient manner.

5.  Big Idea Ventures is a major supporter of female-founded companies
    and women founders of colour

According to [Vegan Women
Summit](https://veganwomensummit.com/pathfinder), less than 3% of all
investment dollars go to female-founded companies, and yet companies
with a female founder [performed 63%
better](https://vegconomist.com/society/investments-in-female-led-companies-perform-63-better-than-in-all-male-founding-teams/)
than investments in all-male founding teams. Over 50% of startups in Big
Idea Ventures' accelerator portfolio are founded by women, and for our
latest cohort, 100% of our Singapore cohort companies have a female
founder or co-founder.
