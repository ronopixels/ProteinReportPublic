Cellular Agriculture Australia (CAA) has updated their interactive tool
'Pathways into Cellular Agriculture' with the addition of non-STEM
'Problems to Solve'. 'Pathways' is an initiative from CAA designed to
drive more talent into cellular agriculture, an emerging industry and
research field dedicated to producing animal products (such as meat,
seafood, eggs, dairy, and leather) using cells rather than animals.

CAA initially developed 'Pathways' to assist students and job seekers in
mapping technical STEM career pathways within areas of cellular
agriculture research. But with the field rapidly growing, the focus has
expanded to include the social, economic, cultural, and political
dimensions of cellular agriculture that must be addressed if the
industry is going to realise its potential once regulatory approval has
been granted. 

Version 2 incorporates current non-STEM research focus areas alongside
those existing for STEM, creating a multidisciplinary tool that is
reflective of the emerging needs of the industry and the diversity of
talent needed to enter and power the field. Drawing on a range of
existing publications and developed in consultation with research and
industry experts, the initial non-STEM areas include public perception,
policy and regulation, funding and investment, transition research, and
commerce. The tool's target user groups are high school and university
students, graduates, and professionals who are curious about a career in
cellular agriculture and want to explore current research focus areas.

"Students want to know what sorts of roles are out there, and what
skills and knowledge will qualify them to be employed and to succeed in
those roles,\'\' says Founder of CAA, Dr Bianca Le.

"Increasingly, professionals in adjacent industries are also reaching
out to us to learn how they can apply their existing expertise to forge
a new career pathway into cellular agriculture." 

Dr. Sam Perkins, CAA's incoming CEO, adds, "The 'Pathways' tool acts as
a bridge for people who are inspired to play a part in advancing
cellular agriculture but are unsure where to begin. The tool highlights
the wonderfully diverse range of talent opportunities available to
passionate individuals looking to make a difference in our food system."

The update comes at a timely stage in the development of the industry.
There are currently over [100
startups](https://gfi.org/resource/alternative-protein-company-database/)
in the space globally, with some companies opening the first of various
pilot production facilities for cellular agriculture products.
Governments around the world including the Dutch, Israeli and United
States are starting to invest in the development of the technology,  and
begin mapping a path towards regulatory approval and commercialisation.
Here in Australia, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)
[anticipates an application from a cultivated meat
company](https://futurealternative.com.au/cultivated-meat-could-be-on-australian-shelves-next-year/)
in the next few weeks, meaning we could see cultivated meat on
Australian shelves next year. 

\"Cellular agriculture has made incredible technology gains recently,
but could still falter if we don\'t consider the social, economic, and
political contexts. We need to start working on the social opportunities
and consequences of cellular agriculture to ensure its success beyond
the lab.\" Says Dr. Adam Cardilini, a lecturer in Environmental Sciences
at Deakin University.

The 'Pathways' tool was based on a range of existing resources in the
cellular agriculture field, and designed to be used as a comprehensive
and cohesive resource to help individuals launch their future career in
cellular agriculture. Although designed for Australian-based users, this
tool could be replicated in many countries. CAA welcomes queries from
any interested parties in developing a similar tool.

[Cellular Agriculture
Australia](https://cellularagricultureaustralia.org/) is a nonprofit
organisation dedicated to accelerating the cellular agriculture sector
in Australia. Their initiatives are focused on developing talent
pipelines into cellular agriculture, creating a connected and
collaborative community within the sector, and promoting positive
awareness of cellular agriculture.
