***NuCicer debuts chickpeas with 75% higher protein content developed
naturally using wild genetic diversity***

Davis, CA, December 20, 2021 --- NuCicer, a crop genetics company
pioneering new varieties of chickpea, unveiled today ultra-high protein
varieties with 75% more protein than conventional chickpeas. The new
varieties will cut the cost of chickpea protein nearly in half, making
it cost-competitive with other plant proteins such as soy, wheat and
pea.

"Chickpeas are the ideal plant protein, with a neutral flavor and color,
excellent functionality, and positive consumer sentiment," said Kathryn
Cook, NuCicer co-Founder and CEO. "Now for the first time, NuCicer's new
varieties -- the product of ten years of research amassing and
crossbreeding the world's largest and most systematic collection of wild
crop progenitors with cultivated chickpea -- will enable chickpea
protein to outcompete other leading plant proteins like soy, wheat and
pea."

Chickpea is already the third most widely grown grain legume and a
significant source of human nutrition worldwide. The United Nations
recognizes chickpea and other pulses as a key global crop for our food
system and promotes their nutritional and environmental importance
through a yearly "World Pulses Day". NuCicer shares this vision and is
reinventing the chickpea as a resilient crop for the future with
increased protein content and targeted functional and nutritional
properties. The range of new varieties developed by NuCicer will enable
more sustainable, affordable plant proteins as well as high-protein,
gluten-free flours and whole bean products. Additionally, NuCicer is
working to increase yield and production stability by incorporating
traits for environmental resilience such as heat and drought tolerance.

NuCicer's background chickpea germplasm stems from international
research projects spanning the last decade led by Professor Douglas R.
Cook from the University of California Davis. International researchers
trekked through southeastern Turkey with permission from local
authorities to collect thousands of samples of wild crop progenitors. By
crossbreeding this wild material with cultivated chickpea varieties,
scientists expanded available genetic diversity by 40 times and
discovered important traits that do not exist in either the cultivated
or wild material alone. NuCicer uses this extraordinary genetic
potential to bring high-value traits such as increased protein content
to market and contributes back to global biodiversity and food security
efforts through an international treaty with the Food and Agriculture
Organization of Â the United Nations. The company is now scaling
operations with a plan for commercial protein and flour ingredient
production in 2023.

"We are excited by our initial progress and the breadth of opportunity
as we begin to partner with leading food and beverage brands," added
Kathryn Cook. "We are in conversations with partners who recognize the
opportunity of new ingredients from our high-protein chickpeas and are
moving quickly to enable meaningful impact across the agri-food supply
chain."
