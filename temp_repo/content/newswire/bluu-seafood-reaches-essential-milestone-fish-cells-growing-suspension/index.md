**Berlin, Dec 13th, 2022.** Bluu Seafood, the leading cultivated fish
company in Europe, has successfully adapted its proprietary fish cell
lines to growth in suspension without the use of microcarriers or other
scaffolds. This is a crucial step that will enable fish cell production
in large scale stirred-tank bioreactors.

Establishment of cell suspensions is the latest milestone in a series of
R&D breakthroughs that include development of GMO-free immortalized
cell-lines and of high-performance growth media without Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS). Together, these achievements put the young German food tech
company in a pole position in the race to industrial-scale seafood
production. The required process optimization and scale-up work will
take place in Bluu's new location currently being built in Hamburg
(Germany). The facility will include a pilot plant, state-of-the art R&D
labs and offices.

"This important achievement allows us to adhere to our ambitious
research & development timelines," says CEO Dr. Sebastian Rakers. "We
are on track to kick off pilot production in Hamburg in 2023 and will
enter the first phase of the commercialization of our products as
planned".

In general, cell suspensions are the best system for production of
animal cells at a truly large scale. Therefore, establishing cell
suspensions is an important goal for every company in the cultivated
food space. However, it has proven to be extremely difficult to
implement such a system for mammalian cells as well as for fish cells.
Therefore, many companies either apply genetic engineering technologies
or use Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) or Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
(iPSCs).

The German company's GMO-free approach is based on the generation of
small aggregates of cells called spheroids. In these spheroids cells
adhere to each other and grow protected while being stirred in the
bioreactor. Under normal conditions these spheroids would simply
continue to grow into large spheres. Cells in the center would then
start dying because nutrients cannot reach the inner layers. "But our
bioprocess development team has developed a process that keeps the
spheroids below a certain size while maintaining cell proliferation.
Thus, the new method involving specific adjustments of growth media
composition and bio-processing parameters allows continuous cell
production in suspension," comments Dr Duong T. Nguyen, Bluu's Director
of Research and Bioprocess Innovation.

As no microcarriers or other scaffold materials are used, cells can be
harvested and processed without any further treatments. Additional
materials add complexity and can influence the taste, texture, and color
of the final product. The lack of these gives Bluu maximum flexibility
in the downstream use of the cells.

Growing seafood products from cells is a promising solution to relieve
the harvesting pressure on our maritime ecosystems, which are further
being depleted as seafood consumption skyrockets: while over 90% of our
oceans are either overfished or fished to a maximum sustainable level
(FAO 2020), seafood sales, which already amount to more than \$500B
globally, are projected to reach \$1T by 2035 (Statista 2022).

**About Bluu Seafood**

The food technology company Bluu Seafood (formerly Bluu Biosciences) is
the first company in Europe to specialize in the commercial production
of cultivated fish. As a pioneer at the intersection of biotechnology
and food technology, Bluu Seafood is producing healthy, sustainable, and
delicious cultivated fish products. The aim is to produce these products
in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, thus making a significant
contribution to securing the future supply of animal protein. The food
technology company, based in Berlin and with scientific facilities in
Lübeck, was founded in 2020 by Dr Sebastian Rakers and Simon Fabich with
an expert team of marine biologists, cell biologists, tissue engineers
and food engineers. In April 2021, entrepreneur, and molecular biologist
Dr Christian Dammann joined the management team as Chief Operating
Officer. In research & development, Bluu Seafood cooperates closely with
the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Individualized and Cell-Based
Medical Engineering (IMTE, formerly EMB) in Lübeck and owns a
state-of-the-art R&D environment. More information at
