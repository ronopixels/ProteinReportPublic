Ibbenbüren/Germany, April 2023 -- The German Crespel & Deiters Group,
one of the leading wheat processors in Europe, has entered the US market
with a newly founded subsidiary: Crespel & Deiters Food USA LP. The
offer comprises a range of in-house produced non-GMO functional
wheat-based ingredients as well as application-oriented manufacturing
expertise from Loryma, the Group\'s food specialist. This way, they want
to help manufacturers to respond to the increasing demand for
sustainable plant-based products such as authentic meat alternatives.

With the founding of the American subsidiary in Chicago, Illinois, the
Crespel & Deiters Group is making its functional wheat-based ingredients
available to industrial customers in North America. Two experienced
sales staff have been recruited to look after existing customers as well
as new ones. To keep the delivery times short, local storage capacities
have been installed.

In Europe, the owner-managed group of companies is one of the leading
manufacturers of wheat starches and wheat proteins. They are
characterised by a unique value chain that combines the entire process
train under one roof, resulting in premium quality wheat ingredients. In
the field of plant-based alternatives for animal products, such as egg
and meat substitutes, the technological advantages offer significant
benefits.

For example, the wheat texturates of the Lory® Tex range, in combination
with wheat-based binders, provide an authentic meat-like texture and
offer a lot of room for individual new end product design. The system
solutions offered, for example breading and hydrolysates for protein
enrichment, can be combined. Application experts at Loryma can who
support customers with application concepts, inspiration and assistance
with product development.

Philipp Deiters, member of the Crespel & Deiters executive board and a
sixth-generation family member, explains: "By specialising in wheat, we
have built up a wealth of experience with time. Our company's mission is
to maximise the use of this renewable raw material to create innovative
solutions. This allows our customers to achieve more with less, all with
the purpose of cooperating to conserve our planet's resources. We are
confident that we can also convince our American customers of their
functionality."
