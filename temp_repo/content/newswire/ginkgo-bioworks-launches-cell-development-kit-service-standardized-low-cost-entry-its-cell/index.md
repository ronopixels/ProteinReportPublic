BOSTON, Nov. 11, 2021 \-- [Ginkgo
Bioworks](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3355864-1&h=3149470297&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ginkgobioworks.com%2F&a=Ginkgo+Bioworks) (NYSE: [DNA](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ginkgo-bioworks-launches-cell-development-kit-service-for-standardized-low-cost-entry-to-its-cell-programming-platform-301421988.html#financial-modal)),
the leading horizontal platform for cell programming, today announced
the launch of its Cell Development Kits (CDKs) service. CDKs provide
streamlined access to the company\'s platform for aspiring cell
developers to program cells to tackle the biggest challenges facing
society. The first CDKs to launch are focused on protein expression
programs. The service provides developers access to the toolkit needed
to get started developing commercial proteins, including pre-engineered
host cells optimized for protein production, specialized equipment,
automation capabilities, genetic engineering expertise, insights
garnered from Ginkgo\'s codebase and the applicable infrastructure to
design, build and test a custom microbe.

Ginkgo\'s CDKs are designed to cut the cost of launching a cell program
and speed up development timelines to build engineered microbes, for
example, to determine whether a protein may be successfully and
commercially produced. The service is also designed to enable customers
to prototype their idea in phases, with each phase providing data that
can inform the customer\'s project and business strategy. By simplifying
the pathway for companies to get started on the Ginkgo platform with
standard terms, a phased approach, low costs---starting at \$100,000 for
protein expression projects---and clear deliverables, the CDK can help
derisk projects prior to full scale technical development.

\"We believe engineering biology holds tremendous potential to
revolutionize industries and our customers are using it to develop
solutions ranging from alternative food proteins and vaccine ingredients
to biodegradable plastics and sustainable chemicals,\" said Jason Kelly,
CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks. \"But biology is still complex and highly
variable, making the barrier to entry too high for many of the product
developers that are out there with an idea they want to bring to the
world. By providing these researchers, entrepreneurs and dreamers with
the resources to realize their proof of concept, we\'re able to support
the synthetic biology ecosystem to keep pushing the envelope on
innovation.\"

**Forward-Looking Statements of Ginkgo Bioworks **\
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements
regarding the launch and potential benefits of Ginkgo\'s \"Cell
Development Kits\" (CDKs) service and the potential of Ginkgo\'s cell
programming platform generally. These forward-looking statements
generally are identified by the words \"believe,\" \"project,\"
\"potential,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\"
\"strategy,\" \"future,\" \"opportunity,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\"
