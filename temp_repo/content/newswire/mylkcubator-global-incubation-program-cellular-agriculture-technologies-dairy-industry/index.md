Pascual, a leading Spanish manufacturer of dairy products and beverages,
has launched Mylkcubator 2.0, the second edition of the global
incubation program for cellular agriculture technologies in the dairy
industry. The initiative has been launched from the group's Corporate
Venture unit, Pascual Innoventures, in collaboration with Eatable
Adventures, one of the top three global foodtech accelerators. The first
edition of the program had recently been completed by four disruptive
startups worldwide.

Mylkcubator 2.0 will last 6 months, from selection to the demo day. The
goal is to enroll a new cohort of up to 5 startups or scientific
projects, with innovative solutions in the cellular agriculture spectrum
for the dairy industry within the following technologies: molecular
farming, fermentation based, cell based, and applied technologies in
this field. All the details about the program are available on the
official website mylkcubator.com.

Pascual Innoventures has flexible venturing models that build,
collaborate and support Foodtech startups in its early stages. The
incubator will help the selected startups in their business and R&D
advancement strategies, preparing them for growth and investment rounds.

In the words of Gabriel Pascual, director of Pascual Innoventures \"The
quality of the startups selected in the first edition has been amazing
and shows us that this is, clearly, the way to go. The visibility of
these projects as well as the investment rounds that they are receiving
is a sign that the industry is prepared for this technological
transition. Pascual has been a pioneer in shaping the path of innovation
and non-conformism. An attitude that has been hatched generation after
generation from my grandfather until our generation."

On the other hand, José Luis Cabañero, CEO and founder of Eatable
Adventures, has remarked "Mylkcubator has attracted the attention of
companies, technology centers and professional investors from all over
the world demonstrating that there is a great opportunity in the market
to implement scalable technological solutions to future proof the dairy
industry". Proof of this is that investment in the dairy segment has
tripled in 2021, compared with 2020, according to Dealroom data analyzed
by Eatable Adventures.

The production of dairy products using cell cultures and fermentation
techniques, that are complementary within the dairy industry,
demonstrate industrial and commercial viability and presents a huge
opportunity for the sector from both an economic and environmental point
of view.
