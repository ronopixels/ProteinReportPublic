Mylkcubator, the first global incubator specialized in the advancement
of innovation projects for the dairy sector, launches its first edition
with four amazing startups selected from across the world. Thanks to
this incubation program, launched by Pascual Innoventures in
collaboration with Eatable Adventures, these promising startups are set
to lay the foundations for a new path of development and innovation for
the dairy industry and respond to the big challenges it faces.

Mylkcubator is not only the world's first incubator specialized in the
dairy sector, but also establishes itself as an international reference
with its four chosen startups coming from different continents. These
startups were carefully selected for their projects and technological
developments to obtain the dairy products of the future.

According to Sejal Ravji, director of Pascual Innoventures,
*\"Mylkcubator launches its first edition with the aim of marking a
dramatic before and after in food innovation. I think we are facing
global challenges that can only be resolved thanks to bold bets like
this; it's a starting point for the development of the dairy products of
the future.  It's a very ambitious project at many levels, including
technological, but we're partnering with leading experts, companies, and
investors from all over the world who share our vision to make it
happen\".*

Thus, Pascual, through Pascual Innoventures continues to promote
innovation, anticipate trends and create a more sustainable food system
future for all. The Mylkcubator program is another testament to their
commitment to this end.

**The selected startups:**

-   **Real** **Deal Milk** (Spain) develops milk proteins through
    precision fermentation in order to make dairy products that are
    produced without animals but are nutritionally and gastronomically
    equivalent to traditional dairy products.
-   **Zero Cow** **Factory** (India) producing India\'s first milk &
    dairy products (certainly a world\'s first in A2 milk protein) using
    microbial bioengineering & precision fermentation.
-   **De Novo Dairy** (South Africa) uses precision fermentation
    technology to produce animal-free dairy proteins that provide the
    same sensory experience and nutrition as their traditional dairy
    counterparts.
-   **M2Factors** (USA) 108Labs\' subsidiary M2Factors, Inc is
    accelerating the state of the art in cell-cultured dairy by crashing
    the cost of production.

The launch of Mylkcubator has attracted the attention of companies,
technology centers and professional investors from all over the world.

Renowned research hubs have already expressed their willingness to
collaborate with some of the selected startups in the development of
their research. In fact, these partnerships will allow the teams to work
in some of the most cutting-edge facilities of these research centers,
'professionalizing' and boosting the development process of the
projects.

In addition, leading funds investing in startups working on technologies
for developing protein alternatives in the agri-food sector, such as
Blue Horizon, Lever VC, Unovis or Ninepointfive, a venture capital fund
specialised in leveraging corporate acceleration, will also monitor
Mylkcubator\'s technological developments to advise these startups and
look for future collaboration opportunities to maximize the potential of
their projects.

The incubation program will commence with the first sessions to
determine the state of development of each project both at a business
and technological level with guidance from Pascual Innoventures, Eatable
Adventures and the investors and partners involved. In addition, the
feasibility of the innovations and the possible development of pilot
projects for future business opportunities in the dairy sector will be
studied.
