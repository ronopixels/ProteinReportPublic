Rehovot, 20.03.2023: Israeli molecular farming company PoLoPo has
closed  a \$1.75m funding round to double down on developing its
proprietary technology to grow animal proteins in potatoes - the world's
most widely grown non-cereal food crop. The Pre-seed round was led by
FoodLabs, further investors include CPT Capital, Siddhi Capital, Plug
and Play Ventures, Milk & Honey Ventures and HackCapital. With the fresh
funding, PoLoPo will further expand its core team of world-class
scientists and accelerate their R&D efforts in order to offer prototypes
in the coming year and a half.

PoLoPo has developed a proprietary technology to express proteins in
potatoes in a scalable, cost-effective way, in order to meet the food
industries' protein demands and to nourish the world's growing
population. The company is building a technology platform for protein
production, starting out with Ovalbumin (protein of the egg white),
targeting the \$26.6 billion egg protein market as well as the growing
demand for egg white protein alternatives from the industry. PoLoPo's
Ovalbumin will be identical to "real" egg Ovalbumin in terms of
functionality, nutritional value, and protein sequence. 

"We're glad to have won a group of such renowned and like-minded
investors", said Dr. Maya Sapir-Mir. "With this substantial funding we
are aiming to reach several significant milestones including protein
rich potato tubers and Ovalbumin functional samples."

"We want to produce better food for the world. Molecular farming
technology, being harnessed for the production of high-quality proteins,
presents a huge opportunity to do so, alongside with taking the animals
out of the equation and reducing the carbon footprint of the production
process" said Dr. Raya Liberman-Aloni 

Produced in over 100 countries worldwide and the third most important
food crop in the world, potatoes are an abundant, resilient, cheap, and
versatile yet underused food source. PoLoPo's potato-to-protein pathway
commercial scalability since plants require relatively low investment to
grow and are amenable to upscaling by common agricultural practice.

"We've been very impressed by the disruptive potential of their platform
technology and, most importantly, by the deep plant science expertise of
PoLoPo\'s founders and their bold vision for the company", said
Christian Guba, "We believe they are set to complement the incumbents in
Precision Fermentation by pioneering a simpler approach to develop
proteins."

PoLoPo founders Dr. Maya Sapir-Mir and Dr. Raya Liberman-Aloni  are
plant metabolic engineers, experts in expression and targeting of
functional proteins in plants. The co-founders met over 15 years ago,
during their PhD studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and
worked side by side for 6 years.

PoLoPo has won the Coller startup competition FoodTech track, which took
place in July 2022, thus securing its first investment from CPT
Capital. 

In October 2022, PoLoPo were crowned winners of the [FoodHack Demo
Day](https://foodhack.global/articles/meet-the-winners-of-the-foodhack-demo-day)
as the startup with the most impact potential. 

**About PoLoPo**

PoLoPo is a science based FoodTech startup using molecular farming
technology that enables the production of real animal proteins without
using any animals. PoLoPo is developing a plant to be used as a protein
bio-factory. This plant will serve as a robust platform for high scale,
easy to switch, custom-made production of proteins with egg protein
being its first target to be produced in an edible plant. Using directed
metabolic engineering techniques, while exploiting the full potential of
plants as diverse metabolite and green protein factory, PoLoPo creates a
potato plant able to produce considerable high amounts of free
amino-acids, to be used as building blocks for high scale production of
proteins in the potato tuber.
