Technology disrupter CellulaREvolution, which aims to revolutionise the
way cells are grown in labs, has raised £1million from a set of
strategic investors including CPT Capital, Stephan Schmidt, Orange Light
Ventures, and funds managed by Northstar Ventures, the North East
Innovation Fund supported by the European Regional Development Fund and
the newly launched Northern Accelerator Seed Investment Fund (NASIF).

CellulaREvolution, a spin out from Newcastle University, was founded in
2019 by Martina Miotto, Che Connon and Leo Groenewegen. It is developing
ground-breaking technologies to make the culturing of cells more
efficient and affordable. The process is based on the novel concept of a
continuous cell culturing system which has a higher yield, smaller
footprint and lower input requirements than traditional batch
technologies. Alex Buchan, Investment Director at Northstar Ventures,
said:

\"*We are delighted to continue supporting CellulaREvolution, not only
are we very impressed with the team, they have a clearly identified
market opportunity and a ground breaking, scalable solution. They are
developing a technology which could be fundamental to the economics of
production, and a real game changer. It also demonstrates the innovation
and ambition that is prevalent in spin outs here in the North East.*\"

To date, CellulaREvolution has identified potential benefits from their
technologies within the medical and pharmaceutical industries,
especially when looking at the production of cell-based therapies, blood
products or viral vectors.

Most importantly, CellulaREvolution also sees opportunities across the
cultivated meat industry. Cultivated meat producers are focused on
disrupting traditional agriculture by providing a suitable alternative
to slaughtered meat. The technologies that CellulaREvolution produces
will enable this industry to produce at real scale and at affordable
cost contributing to far reaching environmental and ethical benefits.

Leo Groenewegen CEO of CellulaREvolution said, "*The investment is a
clear sign that investors both understand and believe the technological
advantage our future products will have over others in this rapidly
expanding market. We are now ready and equipped to accelerate the
development of our products and make a true innovative impact on the way
cells are grown!*"

Most notable is the commitment made by CPT Capital who are an expert
investor in the alternative protein space and were early investors in
the world's leading cultivated meat producers, for instance; Memphis
Meats, Aleph Farms and BlueNalu. "*CPT Capital are genuinely excited to
be able to support CellulaREvolution in this financing round. The work
that they are doing is of critical importance in establishing cultivated
meat as a realistic, viable and attractive alternative to factory
farming in meeting the world's growing demand for food,*" the company
said.

David Huntley, Head of Company Creation at Newcastle University and its
project lead for Northern Accelerator, said: "*This investment in
CellulaREvolution is a clear example of the strength of our university
spin-outs, with the company already making great strides as a
change-maker in its industry. It is a highly investible business with an
exciting future ahead. With Northern Accelerator support, a strong
management team has been formed, bringing an industry-experienced CEO
together with the founding academics, to create a business that will
realise a significant impact as it takes ground-breaking research from
the lab to the world.*"
