description: "Growing global demand for meat and dairy products continues to place unsustainable burdens on our planet’s limited resources. Animal agriculture is linked to nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is a significant driver of both water scarcity and land-use change. As one of the largest buyers and sellers of meat and dairy products, the $570 billion global fast-food sector is increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of a warming planet on these animal protein supply chains."

Growing global demand for meat and dairy products continues to place
unsustainable burdens on our planet's limited resources. Animal
agriculture is linked to nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and is a significant driver of both water scarcity and
land-use change. As one of the largest buyers and sellers of meat and
dairy products, the \$570 billion global fast-food sector is
increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of a warming planet on these
animal protein supply chains.
