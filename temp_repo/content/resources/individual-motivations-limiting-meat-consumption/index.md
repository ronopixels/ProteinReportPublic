Purpose\
The aim of this paper is to identify predictors of meat consumption and
the intention to reduce it. Since meat consumption is one of the major
contributors to human made environmental destruction including climate
change, biodiversity loss or water and air pollution and at the same
time under volitional control meat consumption is an interesting target
for interventions.

Design/methodology/approach\
An integrated model was derived from the theory of planned behaviour,
the norm activation theory and the protection motivation theory which
was tested in a paper-pencil based questionnaire study including
self-reported meat consumption was conducted with a convenience sample
of 210 adult inhabitants of Trondheim (Norway).

Findings\
The model was confirmed to a large extent. Meat consumption was
predicted strongly by meat eating habits, but also negatively by
reduction intentions. Reduction intentions were determined by attitudes,
moral beliefs and health beliefs. Moral beliefs were predicted by
injunctive and descriptive norms as well as perceived
behavioural control.

Research limitations/implications\
The study was based on a convenience sample, thus the sample is not
representative. Furthermore, some of the measurement instruments are of
only mediocre quality.

Practical implications\
The results show that interventions to reduce meat consumption need to
include habits braking components to be effective. Meat consumption
reduction is motivated by a broad array of motivations, including
morality and health. Intervention campaigns need to cover this spectrum.

Originality/value\
This study is one of the first that systematically analyses determinants
of meat consumption which makes it valuable in spite of its limitations.
