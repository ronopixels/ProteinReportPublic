While global demand for sustainable protein grows as a solution to an
increasingly food-insecure world, ramping up efficient, safe, production
is relatively uncharted territory. A groundbreaking new report from
[CRB]{.caps} -- a leading provider of sustainable engineering,
architecture, construction and consulting solutions to the food
industry, probes the rewards and risks of traversing this new market.
From the realities of materials cost, regulation and scalability
challenges, to speed-to-market and sustainability, [CRB]{.caps}'s new
"Horizons: Alternative Proteins" report finds the pioneers of the
alternative proteins revolution at an incredibly dynamic moment.

[CRB]{.caps}'s Horizons report is based on survey responses from more
than 300 industry leaders weighing in on key issues facing their
organizations, from the need to progress to large-scale commercial
manufacturing sustainably to navigating regulations as perceptions of
affordability --- and taste --- change.
