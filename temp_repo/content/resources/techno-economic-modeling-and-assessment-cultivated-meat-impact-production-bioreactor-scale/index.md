Increases in global meat demands cannot be sustainably met with current
methods of livestock farming, which has a substantial impact on
greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water consumption, and farm animal
welfare. Cultivated meat is a rapidly advancing technology that produces
meat products by proliferating and differentiating animal stem cells in
large bioreactors, avoiding conventional live-animal farming. While many
companies are working in this area, there is a lack of existing
infrastructure and experience at commercial scale, resulting in many
technical bottlenecks such as scale-up of cell culture and media
availability and costs. In this study, we evaluate theoretical
cultivated beef production facilities with the goal of envisioning an
industry with multiple facilities to produce in total 100,000,000 kg of
cultured beef per year or \~0.14% of the annual global beef production.
Using the computer-aided process design software, SuperPro Designer®,
facilities are modeled to create a comprehensive analysis to highlight
improvements that can lower the cost of such a production system and
allow cultivated meat products to be competitive. Three facility
scenarios are presented with different sized production reactors;
\~42,000 L stirred tank bioreactor (STR) with a base case cost of goods
sold (COGS) of \$35/kg, \~211,000 L STR with a COGS of \$25/kg, and
\~262,000 L airlift reactor (ALR) with a COGS of \$17/kg. This study
outlines how advances in scaled up bioreactors, alternative bioreactor
designs, and decreased media costs are necessary for commercialization
of cultured meat products.
