Cellular agriculture could meet growing demand for animal products, but
yields are typically low and regulatory bodies restrict genetic
modification for cultured meat production. Here we demonstrate the
spontaneous immortalization and genetic stability of fibroblasts derived
from several chicken breeds. Cell lines were adapted to grow as
single-cell suspensions using serum-free culture medium, reaching
densities of 108 × 106 cells per ml in continuous culture, corresponding
to yields of 36% w/v. We show that lecithin activates peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma ([PPAR]{.caps}γ), inducing
adipogenesis in immortalized fibroblasts. Blending cultured
adipocyte-like cells with extruded soy protein, formed chicken strips in
which texture was supported by animal and plant proteins while aroma and
flavour were driven by cultured animal fat. Visual and sensory analysis
graded the product 4.5/5.0, with 85% of participants extremely likely to
replace their food choice with this cultured meat product.
Immortalization without genetic modification and high-yield
manufacturing are critical for the market realization of cultured meat.
