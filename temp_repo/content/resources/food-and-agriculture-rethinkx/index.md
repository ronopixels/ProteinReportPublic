By 2030, the number of cows in the [U.S.]{.caps} will have fallen by 50%
and the cattle farming industry will be all but bankrupt. All other
livestock industries will suffer a similar fate, while the knock-on
effects for crop farmers and businesses throughout the value chain will
be severe.

Rethinking Food and Agriculture shows how the modern food disruption,
made possible by rapid advances in precision biology and an entirely new
model of production we call Food-as-Software, will have profound
implications not just for the industrial agriculture industry, but for
the wider economy, society, and the environment.
