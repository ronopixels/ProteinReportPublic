A growing number of consumers indicate that they are reducing the amount
of meat they eat or are completely abstaining from meat consumption.
Some of them have partly shifted to meat substitutes. In order to gain
insights into the factors determining the decision to eat or not to eat
meat alternatives, the present study extends the Theory of Planned
Behavior ([TPB]{.caps}) with three factors: animal welfare,
environmental and health concerns. Based on a quantitative online study
conducted in Germany we empirically test the hypothesized model using
structural equation modeling. Results show that the constructs--attitude
and subjective norms--significantly influence the behavioral intention
to eat meat alternatives. Furthermore, health concerns are a significant
direct and animal welfare concerns a significant indirect predictor of
consumers' intention to consume alternative meat products. Contrary to
the conclusions of prior literature, environmental concerns have
no influence.
