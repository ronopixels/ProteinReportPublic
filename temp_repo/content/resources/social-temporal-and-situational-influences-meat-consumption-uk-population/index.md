The amount of meat consumed is having a negative impact on both health
and the environment. This study investigated the probability of eating
meat and the amount eaten at a meal within different social, temporal
and situational contexts. Dietary intake data from 4-day diet diaries of
adults (19 years and above) taken from the [UK]{.caps} National Diet and
Nutrition Survey (2008/9-2013/14) were used for the analysis. Individual
eating occasions were identified and the effects of where the food was
eaten, with whom, day of the week, age and gender on the probability of
eating meat and amount of meat eaten were modelled using general linear
mixed models. Each factor showed distinctive effects on the probability
of eating meat and the amount consumed. The amount of meat eaten was
greater when eating with family members compared to when alone or with
other companions. Both the probability and amount of meat eaten in a
single eating occasion were higher on Sundays compared to the rest of
the week. Eating out (e.g. restaurants/cafes) increased the probability
of consuming meat and the amount compared to other situations (e.g.
home, work). When considering the factors influencing meat consumption,
attention must be paid to the effects of social, temporal, and
situational factors as they all work to shape consumption behaviour.
This information should be used in the design of interventions and
development of policies for the most effective way to reduce
meatÂ consumption.
