Recent theorizing suggests that the 4Ns -- that is, the belief that
eating meat is *natural*, *normal*, *necessary*, and *nice --* are
common rationalizations people use to defend their choice of eating
meat. However, such theorizing has yet to be subjected to empirical
testing. Six studies were conducted on the 4Ns. Studies 1a and 1b
demonstrated that the 4N classification captures the vast majority
(83%--91%) of justifications people naturally offer in defense of eating
meat. In Study 2, individuals who endorsed the 4Ns tended also to
objectify (dementalize) animals and included fewer animals in their
circle of moral concern, and this was true independent of social
dominance orientation. Subsequent studies (Studies 3--5) showed that
individuals who endorsed the 4Ns tend not to be motivated by ethical
concerns when making food choices, are less involved in animal-welfare
advocacy, less driven to restrict animal products from their diet, less
proud of their animal-product decisions, tend to endorse Speciesist
attitudes, tend to consume meat and animal products more frequently, and
are highly committed to eating meat. Furthermore, omnivores who strongly
endorsed the 4Ns tended to experience less guilt about their
animal-product decisions, highlighting the guilt-alleviating function of
the 4Ns.
