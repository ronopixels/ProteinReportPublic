description: "The global protein system is reconfiguring rapidly. The primary sources of conventional protein have changed little since the domestication of animals for meat, dairy and eggs. The alternative protein industry is dynamic. Advancing technologies, decreasing cost curves, changing regulations and increasing consumer adoption will lead to substantial gains in market share for alternative protein over the coming decade. All food value chain players can consider their product strategy and participation to capitalize on the alternative proteins trends."

The global protein system is reconfiguring rapidly. The primary sources
of conventional protein have changed little since the domestication of
animals for meat, dairy and eggs. The alternative protein industry is
dynamic. Advancing technologies, decreasing cost curves, changing
regulations and increasing consumer adoption will lead to substantial
gains in market share for alternative protein over the coming decade.
All food value chain players can consider their product strategy and
participation to capitalize on the alternative proteins trends. To reap
future returns, understanding the future consumer will beÂ critical.
