description: "Extruded meat substitutes, due to their high protein content, meat-like texture and meat processing compatibility, are very popular as the main ingredient of plant-based burger patties. The extrusion of plant-based proteins can be performed by two technologies: high moisture extrudates (HME) and low moisture texturized vegetable proteins (TVP). The largest difference between the technologies relates to the moisture content prevailing inside the extrusion barrel. The extrusion processes also vary in their throughput, and yields."

Extruded meat substitutes, due to their high protein content, meat-like
texture and meat processing compatibility, are very popular as the main
ingredient of plant-based burger patties. The extrusion of plant-based
proteins can be performed by two technologies: high moisture extrudates
([HME]{.caps}) and low moisture texturized vegetable proteins
([TVP]{.caps}). The largest difference between the technologies relates
to the moisture content prevailing inside the extrusion barrel. The
extrusion processes also vary in their throughput, and yields. Life
cycle assessment ([LCA]{.caps}) was performed to compare the
environmental performance of the two extrusion technologies applied to
two plant-based raw materials (soymeal and pumpkin seed flour).
Additionally, the study compared plant-based burger patties to meat
burger patties (beef, pork and chicken). The impact of plant-based
burger patties was at least ten-fold lower than meat burger patties.
[TVP]{.caps}-production exhibited a higher environmental impact compared
to [HME]{.caps} (20-40% higher depending on the raw material). The best
performing plant burger patties were [HME]{.caps}-soy-patties, in
contrast with the worst-performing plant [TVP]{.caps}-soy patties.
[TVP]{.caps}-pumpkin seed patties presented lower impacts compared to
[TVP]{.caps}-soyÂ ones.
