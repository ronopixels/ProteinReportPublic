Although daily meat consumption is a widespread habit, many individuals
at the same time put a high value on the welfare of animals. While
different psychological mechanisms have been identified to resolve this
cognitive tension, such as dissociating the animal from the consumed
meat or denying the animal's moral status, few studies have investigated
the effects of the animal's appearance on the willingness to consume its
meat. The present article explored how the perception
of *cuteness* influences hypothetical meat consumption. We hypothesized
that cuter animals would reduce the willingness to consume meat, and
that this relationship would be mediated
by [empathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/empathy "Learn more about Empathy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") felt
towards the animal. Across four pre-registered studies sampling 1074 US
and Norwegian participants, we obtained some support for this prediction
in the US but to a lesser degree in Norway. However, in all studies an
indirect mediation effect of cuteness on meat consumption going through
empathy towards the animal was observed. We also explored possible
moderating and additional mediating mechanisms of trait pro-social
orientation, caretaking intentions and sex effects for which we found
mixed evidence. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings
are discussed.
