Livestock are terrestrial, domesticated animals raised in an
agricultural setting to provide traction or produce commodities such as
meat, milk, eggs and hides. They contribute to diverse agri-food systems
globally, playing many roles for different groups of people. From the
perspective of the sustainability of the global livestock sector, there
are four important and interrelated aspects: food and nutrition
security; livelihoods and growth; health and animal welfare; and climate
and natural resource use. Sustainable livestock are at the interface of
these four topics, which provide the structure of the breakout sessions
in the 10th Global Forum for Food andÂ Agriculture.
