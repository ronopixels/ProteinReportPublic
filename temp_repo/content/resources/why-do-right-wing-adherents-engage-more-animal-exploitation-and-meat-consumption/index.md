Despite the well-documented implications of right-wing ideological
dispositions for human intergroup relations, surprisingly little is
understood about the implications for human--animal relations. We
investigate why right-wing ideologies -- social dominance orientation
(SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) -- positively predict
attitudes toward animal exploitation and meat consumption. Two survey
studies conducted in heterogeneous community samples (Study
1, *N* = 260; Study 2, *N* = 489) demonstrated that right-wing
ideologies predict greater acceptance of animal exploitation and more
meat consumption through two explaining mechanisms: (a) perceived threat
from non-exploitive ideologies to the dominant carnist ideology (for
both SDO and RWA) and (b) belief in human superiority over animals (for
SDO). These findings hold after controlling for hedonistic pleasure from
eating meat. Right-wing adherents do not simply consume more animals
because they enjoy the taste of meat, but because doing so supports
dominance ideologies and resistance to cultural change. Psychological
parallels between human intergroup relations and human--animal relations
are considered.
