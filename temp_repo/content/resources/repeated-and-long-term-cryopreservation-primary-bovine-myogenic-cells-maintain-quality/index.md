Cultured meat produced using cell culture technology can potentially
alleviate many of the ethical, environmental, and public health concerns
associated with conventional livestock meat production. The
industrialization of cultured meat for wide-spread adoption requires new
methods to efficiently collect high-quality cells and to preserve their
cell quality. Cryopreservation is a widely used technique to enable the
long-term storage of cells without causing severe damage. In this study,
we focused on the feasibility of cryopreservation to maintain cell
quality for storage of bovine myogenic cells harvested from bovine meat
based on our unique primary culture method. Primary bovine cells were
incubated in a culture dish and then cryopreserved at −80°C for 1 week
or 1 year. After thawing, the cells were further cultured for several
passages to evaluate the abilities of the cells to proliferate or
differentiate into myotubes. Furthermore, the cells were repeatedly
cryopreserved for 1 week each time to investigate the impact of the
repeated freezing and thawing. Consequently, long-term (within 1 year)
or repeated (up to 3 times for 1 week each) cryopreservation at −80°C
caused no degradation in the abilities of the cells to proliferate or
differentiate, which is important for cultured meat production. We also
confirmed that the cryopreservation did not require any unique cell
freezing media. Moreover, based on our tissue engineering technique, our
cryopreserved bovine myogenic cells had the ability to form sarcomere
structures and produce muscle contractions even after they were frozen
for 1 year. Although the bovine muscle tissues described here require
more mature structures and functions in order to closely mimic native
muscle tissue, we believe that the functional maturation of myogenic
cells is essential to produce a "tissue-engineered meat" that will have
native-like nutrients, texture, and taste that consumers will expect in
the future. These results reveal the potential of cryopreserving
quality-controlled bovine myogenic cells to contribute to a stable
supply of high-quality cells for cultured meat production.
