Recent interest in seaweeds as a source of macronutrients,
micronutrients, and bioactive components has highlighted prospective
applications within the functional food and nutraceutical industries,
with impetus toward the alleviation of risk factors associated with
noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease. This narrative review summarizes the nutritional
composition of edible seaweeds; evaluates the evidence regarding the
health benefits of whole seaweeds, extracted bioactive components, and
seaweed-based food products in humans; and assesses the potential
adverse effects of edible seaweeds, including those related to ingestion
of excess iodine and arsenic. If the potential functional food and
nutraceutical applications of seaweeds are to be realized, more evidence
from human intervention studies is needed to evaluate the nutritional
benefits of seaweeds and the efficacy of their purported bioactive
components. Mechanistic evidence, in particular, is imperative to
substantiate healthÂ claims.
