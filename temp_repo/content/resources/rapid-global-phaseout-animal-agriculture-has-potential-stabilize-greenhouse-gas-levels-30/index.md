Animal agriculture contributes significantly to global warming through
ongoing emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous
oxide, and displacement of biomass carbon on the land used to support
livestock. However, because estimates of the magnitude of the effect of
ending animal agriculture often focus on only one factor, the full
potential benefit of a more radical change remains underappreciated.
Here we quantify the full "climate opportunity cost" of current global
livestock production, by modeling the combined, long-term effects of
emission reductions and biomass recovery that would be unlocked by a
phaseout of animal agriculture. We show that, even in the absence of any
other emission reductions, persistent drops in atmospheric methane and
nitrous oxide levels, and slower carbon dioxide accumulation, following
a phaseout of livestock production would, through the end of the
century, have the same cumulative effect on the warming potential of the
atmosphere as a 25 gigaton per year reduction in anthropogenic
[CO2]{.caps} emissions, providing half of the net emission reductions
necessary to limit warming to 2°C. The magnitude and rapidity of these
potential effects should place the reduction or elimination of animal
agriculture at the forefront of strategies for averting disastrous
climate change.
