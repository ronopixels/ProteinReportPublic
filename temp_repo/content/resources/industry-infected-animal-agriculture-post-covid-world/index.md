This FAIRR report aims to provide investors with insights into the
financially material impacts of the current crisis on the animal protein
sector, and highlights the risk the industry faces due to its potential
to foster future pandemics.

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds globally, we are presented with a
real-time case study into the vulnerability of animal agriculture
systems to external shocks. It has reminded us of the vulnerability of
human health to disease risks stemming from both wild and domestic
animals, and has served as a warning of the role modern animal
production systems can play in increasing zoonotic disease risk.

In this report, we have created a Pandemic Ranking, by adjusting our
existing 2019 Coller FAIRR Protein Producer Index to consider only those
ESG risk factors relevant to this topic.
