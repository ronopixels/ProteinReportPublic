Cell cultivated meat is a relatively new (only about 20 years old) idea
using a technology that has been around for over one hundred years. The
technology necessary to culture cells for human consumption is
developing at a rapid pace. The concept is relativity simple in that it
uses cells of animal origin and raises them in a bioreactor to produce
food that closely mimics meat products traditionally derived from
harvesting animals. While the concept of producing cell cultivated meat
is simple, the implementation has proven to be very challenging. Today,
cell cultivated meat is not available for consumer purchase at retail or
food service outlets. Still, current efforts are underway to scale up
production of cell cultivated meat, but the industry faces several
technology hurdles. Those hurdles include lowering the cost of media
used to cultivate cells, developing cell lines that can be propagated
indefinitely and producing finished products that possess the same
palatable and nutritional characteristics of traditionally produced meat
products. At the same time that technological challenges are being
navigated, other issues such as governmental regulatory oversight,
product labeling, and even nomenclature policy must be addressed. Steps
are currently underway to develop a regulatory framework for cell
cultivated meat and legislation is being considered to provide federal
definitions to ensure clear communication to consumers. In fact, food
products produced from cell culture technology are referred to by many
names such as: "cultivated meat", "clean meat", "cultured meat", "lab
meat", "fake meat", "cell cultivated meat", and "in vitro meat".
Finally, because cell cultivated meat is a brand-new platform in food
production, food safety cannot be overlooked. As with any novel food,
understanding and mitigating potential safety risks is critical. Because
the production systems associated with producing cell cultivated meat
are so different from obtaining meat directly from animal sources, there
may be food consumption hazards that are not present in conventionally
produced meat products. Cell cultivated meat may become available in
retail outlets within the next 5 years. Before that happens, all these
issues and many others must be addressed.
