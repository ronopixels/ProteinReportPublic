description: "The media has recently paid a significant amount of attention to the plant-based food trend, with initiatives such as Veganuary and Meat Free Monday receiving more pick-up than ever before. Manufacturers and retailers have both responded to this trend by launching new vegan-friendly plant-based product lines, as has the food service sector. Yet only a tiny minority of the population are actually vegan, with meat and dairy remaining cornerstones of the British diet. But what factors are driving all this media attention and how does this play out in the marketplace?"

The media has recently paid a significant amount of attention to the
plant-based food trend, with initiatives such as Veganuary and Meat Free
Monday receiving more pick-up than ever before. Manufacturers and
retailers have both responded to this trend by launching new
vegan-friendly plant-based product lines, as has the food service
sector. Yet only a tiny minority of the population are actually vegan,
with meat and dairy remaining cornerstones of the British diet. But what
factors are driving all this media attention and how does this play out
in the marketplace?
