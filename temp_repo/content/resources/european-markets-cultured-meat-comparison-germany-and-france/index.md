The negative impacts of meat consumption for animals, the environment,
and human health are more pressing than ever. Although some evidence
points to an ongoing reduction in meat consumption in Europe, consumers
are overall unwilling to cut their meat consumption in a substantial
way. The present study investigates dietary identities and perceptions
of cultured meat in nationally representative samples from Germany (n =
1000) and France (n = 1000). Participants were recruited through an
Ipsos panel to answer an online survey, which included questions about
their current and intended consumption of conventional meat, as well as
questions about their opinions of cultured meat. We find that, whilst
rates of vegetarianism were relatively low in France, unrestricted
meat-eaters were a minority in Germany, and concern for animal welfare
was the most common reason given for meat reduction. Substantial markets
for cultured meat exist in both countries, although German consumers are
significantly more open to the concept than the French. Strikingly,
cultured meat acceptance is significantly higher amongst agricultural
and meat workers, indicating that those who are closest to existing meat
production methods are most likely to prefer alternatives. We found some
evidence that pro-cultured meat messages, which focus on antibiotic
resistance and food safety, are significantly more persuasive than those
that focus on animals or the environment. Furthermore, consumers project
that they would be significantly more likely to consume cultured meat
that does not contain genetically modified ingredients. Overall, we find
substantially large markets for cultured meat in Germany and France, and
identify some potential ways to further increase acceptance in these
markets. We conclude by highlighting the most promising markets for
cultured meat, and highlighting a lack of antibiotics as a potentially
persuasive message about culturedÂ meat.
