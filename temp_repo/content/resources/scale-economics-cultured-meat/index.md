description: "This analysis examines the potential of “cultured meat” products made from edible animal cell culture to measurably displace the global consumption of conventional meat. Recognizing that the scalability of such products must in turn depend on the scale and process intensity of animal cell production, this study draws on technoeconomic analysis perspectives in industrial fermentation and upstream biopharmaceuticals to assess the extent to which animal cell culture could be scaled like a fermentation process."

This analysis examines the potential of "cultured meat" products made
from edible animal cell culture to measurably displace the global
consumption of conventional meat. Recognizing that the scalability of
such products must in turn depend on the scale and process intensity of
animal cell production, this study draws on technoeconomic analysis
perspectives in industrial fermentation and upstream biopharmaceuticals
to assess the extent to which animal cell culture could be scaled like a
fermentation process. Low growth rate, metabolic inefficiency,
catabolite inhibition, and shear-induced cell damage will all limit
practical bioreactor volume and attainable cell density. Equipment and
facilities with adequate microbial contamination safeguards have high
capital costs. The projected costs of suitably pure amino acids and
protein growth factors are also high. The replacement of amino-acid
media with plant protein hydrolysates is discussed and requires further
study. Capital- and operating-cost analyses of conceptual cell-mass
production facilities indicate economics that would likely preclude the
affordability of their products as food. The analysis concludes that
metabolic efficiency enhancements and the development of low-cost media
from plant hydrolysates are both necessary but insufficient conditions
for displacement of conventional meat by cultured meat.
