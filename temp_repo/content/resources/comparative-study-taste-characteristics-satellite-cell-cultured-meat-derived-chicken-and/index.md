This study investigated the amino acid and nucleotide-related compound
composition and taste characteristics of cultured muscle tissue
([CMT]{.caps}) obtained by culturing satellite cells isolated from
chicken and cattle and compared them to those of traditional meat
([TM]{.caps}). The content of all amino acids except valine and tyrosine
was significantly different between [CMT]{.caps} and [TM]{.caps}
(p\<0.05). The amount of glutamic acid was not significantly different
between [CMT]{.caps} and [TM]{.caps} in cattle, but the glutamic acid in
chicken [CMT]{.caps} was lower than that of [TM]{.caps} (p\<0.05). Among
the nucleotide-related compounds, only the content of
inosine-5'-monophosphate ([IMP]{.caps}) was significant, and the amount
of [IMP]{.caps} in [CMT]{.caps} derived from chicken and cattle was
significantly lower than that of [TM]{.caps} (p\<0.05). There were
significant differences in the taste characteristics assessed by an
electronic tongue system, and the umami, bitterness, and sourness values
of [CMT]{.caps} were significantly lower than those of [TM]{.caps} from
both chicken and cattle (p\<0.05). The results of the present study
suggest that it is necessary to develop a satellite cell culture method
that could increase the umami and bitterness intensity of [CMT]{.caps}
and adjust the composition of the growth medium to produce cultured meat
with a taste similar to that of [TM]{.caps}.
