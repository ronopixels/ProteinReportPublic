Future pandemics will emerge more often, spread more rapidly, do more
damage to the world economy and kill more people than COVID-19 unless
there is a transformative change in the global approach to dealing with
infectious diseases, warns a major new report on biodiversity and
pandemics by 22 leading experts from around the world.

Convened by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ([IPBES](http://www.ipbes.net/)) for
an urgent virtual workshop about the links between degradation of nature
and increasing pandemic risks, the experts agree that escaping the era
of pandemics is possible, but that this will require a seismic shift in
approach from reaction to prevention.

COVID-19 is at least the sixth global health pandemic since the Great
Influenza Pandemic of 1918, and although it has its origins in microbes
carried by animals, like all pandemics its emergence has been entirely
driven by human activities, says the report released on Thursday. It is
estimated that another 1.7 million currently 'undiscovered' viruses
exist in mammals and birds -- of which up to 850,000 could have the
ability to infect people.

"There is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic --
or of any modern pandemic", said Dr. Peter Daszak, President
of [EcoHealth
Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-peter-daszak) and
Chair of the IPBES workshop. "The same human activities that drive
climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through
their impacts on our environment. Changes in the way we use land; the
expansion and intensification of agriculture; and unsustainable trade,
production and consumption disrupt nature and increase contact between
wildlife, livestock, pathogens and people. This is the path to
pandemics."
