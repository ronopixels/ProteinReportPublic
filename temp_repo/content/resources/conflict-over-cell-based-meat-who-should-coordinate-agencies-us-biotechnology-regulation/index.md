The technology to create meat from cellular cultures has nearly arrived,
with potential environmental, animal welfare, and nutritional benefits
over traditional animal agriculture. However, considerable uncertainty
over the regulatory framework for this emerging biotechnology arose
throughout 2018, driven by overlapping statutory authority for the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) with insufficient guidance from the Coordinated Framework for
Regulation of Biotechnology. While the FDA-USDA dispute has begun to
stabilize, it reflects broader uncertainties over how to resolve
jurisdictional disputes in the U.S. oversight of biotechnologies and who
can or should coordinate these agencies. In the absence of a clear legal
framework to answer these questions, this Article analyzes the strengths
and weaknesses of varying public institutions in resolving
jurisdictional disputes over novel biotechnologies. This Article
assesses federal agencies, Congress, and the President with normative
standards of transparency, predictability, and adaptability, considering
the cell-based meat case and emerging biotechnologies broadly for
insights on institutional mediation of interagencyÂ conflict.
