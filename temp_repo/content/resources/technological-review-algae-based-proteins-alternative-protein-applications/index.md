description: "The Good Food Institute India’s mission to accelerate the alternative protein sector includes exploring diverse, sustainable protein sources in India and around the globe. This analysis on algal protein is the first in our protein sources strategic analysis series. The presence of already established companies producing food-grade microalgae and the potential to utilize India’s 8100 km long coastline for seaweed cultivation provides the foundation for the algal protein industry. But the industry in India is at a nascent stage."

The Good Food Institute India's mission to accelerate the alternative
protein sector includes exploring diverse, sustainable protein sources
in India and around the globe. This analysis on algal protein is the
first in our protein sources strategic analysis series. The presence of
already established companies producing food-grade microalgae and the
potential to utilize India's 8100 km long coastline for seaweed
cultivation provides the foundation for the algal protein industry. But
the industry in India is at a nascent stage. Our report 'Technological
Review of Algae-based Proteins' is a result of a strategic assessment of
the algal value chain from strain selection to protein extraction, with
the aim to inform stakeholders in the Indian market about pivotal and
potentially lucrative interventions required to develop the algal
protein sector.
