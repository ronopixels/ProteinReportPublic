This report is an update of the status of the global seaweed market:
production figures from culture and capture, the size of the
international market for seaweed and its commercially important
extracts, the leading nations by region, developments in processing and
utilization technology, and innovations in the industry, as well as
the challenges and outlook for the industry.

As it is not possible to feature all individual countries of importance
in the seaweed sector, several have been selected as being
representative of the different regions of the world: Asia \[China,
Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Thailand); South America (Chile); Europe (Denmark, the European
Union); and Africa\
(Morocco, South Africa and Zanzibar (Tanzania)\]. The sections on Chile,
China, Denmark and South Africa are based largely on previous studies
commissioned by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
