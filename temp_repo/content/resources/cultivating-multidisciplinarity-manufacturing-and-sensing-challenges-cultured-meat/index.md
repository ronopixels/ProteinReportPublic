United Nations estimates that by the year 2050, the population of nearly
10 billion people will have 70% higher food demands than the current
food systems can provide for. This needs to be observed in the context
of the on-going climate change and related negative effects of the
traditional agriculture. Conventional livestock-based value chains
contribute to the high greenhouse gas emissions. Meat cultivation via
cellular agriculture holds great promise as a method for future food
production. Theoretically, it is an ideal way of meat production, humane
to the animals and sustainable for the environment, while keeping the
same taste and nutritional values as traditional meat. However, in
practice, there is still a number of challenges such as large-scale
production, regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance. To address
these challenges a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. In this
optic, we present an overview of the sensor monitoring options for the
most relevant parameters for cultured meat bioprocess. Various examples
of the sensors to potentially apply in cultured meat production are
provided, as well as the options for their integration into different
types of bioreactors. Furthermore, we briefly present the current status
of the cultured meat research and regulation, societal aspects and
itsÂ commercialization.
