Replacement of animal-based products with plant-based products promotes
environmental sustainability and reduces the risk of cardiovascular
diseases and type 2 diabetes. Consumers are aware of recommendations
towards healthier and more sustainable food consumption, but often they
do not follow them. The aim of this study was to examine barriers and
facilitators towards adopting a more plant-based diet among Danish
consumers. Data was collected through an online survey during October
2017. The topics in the questionnaire was based on recent findings from
published literature on the subject. A total of 462 consumers were
segmented based on their frequency intake of animal-based products.
Segments were characterized by their attitudes towards plant-based diets
using a logistic regression. Four segments were identified: Low All
(n = 220), High All (n = 70), High Meat (n = 48), and High Dairy
(n = 124). Negative attitudes about protein content, satiety effect,
taste, environmental and health effects were identified as barriers
towards adopting a more plant-based diet, for segments with a high
intake of either meat or all animal products. The segment with a low
intake of animal products held positive attitudes towards the ease of
cooking, taste, protein content, satiety effect, and availability of
plant-based food, indicating that these attitudes serve as facilitators
towards adopting a more plant-based diet. The results can be used to
inform industry and targeted health campaigns towards promoting
plant-based diets in Denmark and similar countries.
