description: "We present a method of producing bulk cell-cultured fat tissue for food applications. Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D fats using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fats were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests."

We present a method of producing bulk cell-cultured fat tissue for food
applications. Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste
diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially
culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat is
produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled
adipocytes into 3D fats using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The
3D fats were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with
matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical
properties of cultured fat tissues were based on binder choice and
concentration, and changes in the fatty acid compositions of cellular
triacylglyceride and phospholipids were observed after lipid
supplementation (soybean oil) during in vitro culture. This approach of
aggregating individual adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a
scalable and versatile strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for
food-related applications, thereby addressing a key obstacle in
cultivated meatÂ production.
