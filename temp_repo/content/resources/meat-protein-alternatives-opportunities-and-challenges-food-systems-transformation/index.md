Meat alternatives are attracting private investment and interest from
the research community as possible solutions to meet the growing global
demand for proteins in a sustainable, ethical, and healthy way. Using a
food systems lens, this report investigates the opportunities and
challenges associated with three meat alternatives: plant-based, insects
and cultured meat. The analysis is based primarily on a literature
review, which is complemented by an illustrative scenario using the
OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo model. Results from the scenario analysis suggest
that a shift from meat to meat alternatives in high and upper
middle-income countries could result in a decline in global agricultural
land use and GHG emissions from the agriculture, forestry, and other
land use sector. Lower demand for meats in these countries would also
lead to a decrease in international prices for meats, soybean and
cereals, which would benefit consumers but place pressure on farmer
incomes.
