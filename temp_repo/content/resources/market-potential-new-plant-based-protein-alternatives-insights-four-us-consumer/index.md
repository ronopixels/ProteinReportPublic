description: "This article reports results from four studies determining the US market potential for plant-based meat alternatives in different contexts and settings. The first study shows that a pair-wise choice between beef and a plant-based alternative was not significantly affected by the presence of nutrition facts panels or ingredient lists. A second study, framed as a food service meal choice, reveals that the introduction of a plant-based burger has roughly the same effect on beef sales as does the presence of a chicken wrap."

This article reports results from four studies determining the US market
potential for plant-based meat alternatives in different contexts and
settings. The first study shows that a pair-wise choice between beef and
a plant-based alternative was not significantly affected by the presence
of nutrition facts panels or ingredient lists. A second study, framed as
a food service meal choice, reveals that the introduction of a
plant-based burger has roughly the same effect on beef sales as does the
presence of a chicken wrap. The final two studies estimate own- and
cross-price elasticities of retail demand. We find small cross-price
elasticities between plant-based patties and ground beef. Each of the
aforementioned results varies for regular meat consumers as compared to
consumers who self-identify with an alternative diet such as
flexitarian, vegetarian, or vegan. Combined, this study increases
understanding of the impact presented by plant-based offerings in the US
protein market.
