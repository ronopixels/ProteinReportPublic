Cell cultured meat (CCM) production is an innovative technology that
does not depend on livestock farming practices to produce meat. The
construction of structured CCM requires a three-dimensional (3D)
scaffold to mimic the extracellular matrix to provide mechanical support
for the cells. Furthermore, the 3D scaffolds should be edible and have
good biocompatibility and tissue-like texture. Here, we demonstrated a
3D edible chitosan‑sodium alginate-collagen/gelatin (CS-SA-Col/Gel)
scaffold that can support the adhesion and proliferation of porcine
skeletal muscle satellite cells, culminating in the construction of a
structured CCM model. The 3D edible scaffolds were prepared by
freeze-drying using electrostatic interactions between chitosan and
sodium [alginate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/alginate).
Initially, the physicochemical properties and structural characteristics
of different scaffolds were explored, and the biocompatibility of the
scaffolds was evaluated using
the [C2C12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/c2c12) cell
model. The results showed that the 2-CS-SA-Col1-Gel scaffold provided
stable mechanical support and abundant adhesion sites for the cells.
Subsequently, we inoculated porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells on
the 2-CS-SA-Col1-Gel scaffold and induced differentiation for a total of
14 days. Immunofluorescence staining results
showed [cytoskeleton](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cytoskeleton) formation,
and [Western
blotting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/western-blot) (WB)
and qPCR results showed upregulation of skeletal proteins and myogenic
genes. Ultimately, the structured CCM model has similar textural
properties (chewiness, springiness and resilience) and appearance to
those of fresh pork. In conclusion, the method of constructing 3D edible
scaffolds to prepare structured CCM models exhibits the potential to
produce cell cultured meat.
