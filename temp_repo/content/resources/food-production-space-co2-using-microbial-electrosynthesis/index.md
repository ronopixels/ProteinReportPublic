The current food method in space is launching prepackaged food which is
costly and unsustainable. Alternatives include growing crops and
microalgae single cell protein ([SCP]{.caps}) using artificial light
photosynthesis, which are energy inefficient. Prepackaged food and
microalgae food were compared to microbial electrosynthesis of acetic
acid ([MES]{.caps}-[AA]{.caps}). Since the dominant cost of a space
mission is the cost of launching mass, components of a system were
converted to an equivalent mass, including power, heat rejection, and
volume. Three-year roundtrip crewed missions were evaluated for the
International Space Station, the Moon, and Mars. The average Equivalent
System Mass ([ESM]{.caps}) of [MES]{.caps}-[AA]{.caps} is 1.38x and
2.84x lower than prepackaged food and microalgae [SCP]{.caps},
respectively. The expected electricity-to-calorie conversion efficiency
of [MES]{.caps}-[AA]{.caps} is 19.8 %, consuming 3.45 kW to fully feed
five astronauts; diets would realistically include multiple foods.
[MES]{.caps}-[AA]{.caps} has a higher energy efficiency than any
currently investigated resilient food in space. [MES]{.caps}-[AA]{.caps}
can provide diet diversity at a lower cost than customarily storing
prepackaged food or growing crops in space. Producing food while
contributing to closed loop life support in space can contribute to
reducing global catastrophic risk and is relevant in off-grid
communities, like in ruralÂ Alaska.
