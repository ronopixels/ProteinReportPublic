Cultured meat has potential to diversify methods for protein production,
but innovations in production efficiency will be required to make
cultured meat a feasible protein alternative. Microcarriers provide a
strategy to culture sufficient volumes of adherent cells in a bioreactor
that are required for meat products. However, cell culture on inedible
microcarriers involves extra downstream processing to dissociate cells
prior to consumption. Here, we present edible microcarriers that can
support the expansion and differentiation of myogenic cells in a single
bioreactor system. To fabricate edible microcarriers with a scalable
process, we used water-in-oil emulsions as templates for gelatin
microparticles. We also developed a novel embossing technique to imprint
edible microcarriers with grooved topology in order to test if
microcarriers with striated surface texture can promote myoblast
proliferation and differentiation in suspension culture. In this
proof-of-concept demonstration, we showed that edible microcarriers with
both smooth and grooved surface topologies supported the proliferation
and differentiation of mouse myogenic [C2C12]{.caps} cells in a
suspension culture. The grooved edible microcarriers showed a modest
increase in the proliferation and alignment of myogenic cells compared
to cells cultured on smooth, spherical microcarriers. During the
expansion phase, we also observed the formation of cell-microcarrier
aggregates or 'microtissues' for cells cultured on both smooth and
grooved microcarriers. Myogenic microtissues cultured with smooth and
grooved microcarriers showed similar characteristics in terms of myotube
length, myotube volume fraction, and expression of myogenic markers. To
establish feasibility of edible microcarriers for cultured meat, we
showed that edible microcarriers supported the production of myogenic
microtissue from [C2C12]{.caps} or bovine satellite muscle cells, which
we harvested by centrifugation into a cookable meat patty that
maintained its shape and exhibited browning during cooking. These
findings demonstrate the potential of edible microcarriers for the
scalable production of cultured meat in a singleÂ bioreactor.
