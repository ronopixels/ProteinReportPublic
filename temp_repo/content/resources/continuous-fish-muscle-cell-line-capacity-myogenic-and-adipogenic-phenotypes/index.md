description: "Cell-cultivated fish offers the potential for a more ethical, sustainable, and safe seafood system. However, fish cell culture is relatively understudied in comparison to mammalian cells. Here, we established and characterized a continuous Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) skeletal muscle cell line (“Mack” cells). The cells were isolated from muscle biopsies of fresh-caught fish, with separate isolations performed from two distinct fish. Mack1 cells (cells from the first isolation) were cultured for over a year and subcultured over 130 times."

Cell-cultivated fish offers the potential for a more ethical,
sustainable, and safe seafood system. However, fish cell culture is
relatively understudied in comparison to mammalian cells. Here, we
established and characterized a continuous Atlantic mackerel (Scomber
scombrus) skeletal muscle cell line ("Mack" cells). The cells were
isolated from muscle biopsies of fresh-caught fish, with separate
isolations performed from two distinct fish. Mack1 cells (cells from the
first isolation) were cultured for over a year and subcultured over 130
times. The cells proliferated at initial doubling times of 63.9 h
(± 19.1 [SD]{.caps}). After a spontaneous immortalization crisis from
passages 37--43, the cells proliferated at doubling times of 24.3 h
(± 4.91 [SD]{.caps}). A muscle phenotype was confirmed through
characterization of muscle stemness and differentiation via paired-box
protein 7 and myosin heavy chain immunostaining, respectively. An
adipocyte-like phenotype was also demonstrated for the cells through
lipid accumulation, confirmed via Oil Red O staining and quantification
of neutral lipids. New qPCR primers ([HPRT]{.caps}, [PAX3B]{.caps},
[MYOD1]{.caps}, [MYOG]{.caps}, [TNNT3A]{.caps}, and [PPARG]{.caps}) were
tailored to the mackerel genome and used to characterize mackerel cell
genotypes. This work provides the first spontaneously immortalized fish
muscle cell line for research, ideally serving as a reference for
subsequent investigation.
