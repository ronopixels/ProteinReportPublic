In 2013, Mark Post and his colleagues at the University of Maastricht
presented the first cultured meat (in-vitromeat) burger made from bovine
stem cells. The technological innovation is intended to offer a
possibility of reducing or even eliminating the negative effects of
current meat production and meat consumption on humans, animals, and the
environment. Large scale production, however, is not yet possible, and
the question remains whether cultured meat will be able to keep what the
developers promise. The following article^1^ deals with this question,
addressing the results of expert and stakeholder interviews as well as
participative processes that were carried out in a project at the
Institut für Technikfolgenabschätzung und Systemanalyse (Institute for
Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis = ITAS). Among other aspects,
the manufacturing process, possible impact on the environment, animals
and humans, consumer acceptance, as well as the subsidy of research and
development of cultured meat will be discussed. Cultured meat presents
an interesting alternative to conventional meat production, although
many questions are as yet unanswered, particularly with regard to
technical feasibility and ethical as well as social aspects. More
research is essential; the search for a sustainable alternative to
current meat production should, however, also involve other approaches
such as ecological agriculture.
