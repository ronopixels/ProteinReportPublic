Meat consumption is conflicted, because meat provides pleasure to many
people, but it also causes animals to suffer. This so-called meat
paradox elicits discomfort in meat-eaters and they try to reduce their
discomfort, for example, by means of moral disengagement. In the present
investigation, we tried to scrutinize this process and examine the
boundary conditions that increase moral disengagement. We assumed that,
due to a domain general action-oriented state, people tend to resolve
the meat paradox via moral disengagement, even if inconsistency is
elicited in a different, not food-related domain. Two experiments were
conducted, in which we assessed people's moral disengagement efforts via
ambivalence measures after we induced inconsistency using different
threats in meat-unrelated domains. Supporting our assumptions, people
showed reduced ambivalence towards food in affective priming
(Experiment 1) and Mouse-Tracker tasks (Experiment 2) after experiencing
inconsistency. In fact, plant-based dishes became more positive and meat
dishes more negative after inconsistency was induced, indicating that
people disguise their endorsement of meat. This provides first
convergent evidence that an inconsistency induced action-oriented state
may influence cognitions regarding the meatÂ paradox.
