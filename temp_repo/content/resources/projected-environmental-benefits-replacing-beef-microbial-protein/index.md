Ruminant meat provides valuable protein to humans, but livestock
production has many negative environmental impacts, especially in terms
of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and
eutrophication. In addition to a dietary shift towards plant-based
diets, imitation products, including plant-based meat, cultured meat and
fermentation-derived microbial protein ([MP]{.caps}), have been proposed
as means to reduce the externalities of livestock production. Life cycle
assessment ([LCA]{.caps}) studies have estimated substantial
environmental benefits of [MP]{.caps}, produced in bioreactors using
sugar as feedstock, especially compared to ruminant meat. Here we
present an analysis of [MP]{.caps} as substitute for ruminant meat in
forward-looking global land-use scenarios towards 2050. Our study
complements [LCA]{.caps} studies by estimating the environmental
benefits of [MP]{.caps} within a future socio-economic pathway. Our
model projections show that substituting 20% of per-capita ruminant meat
consumption with [MP]{.caps} globally by 2050 (on a protein basis)
offsets future increases in global pasture area, cutting annual
deforestation and related [CO2]{.caps} emissions roughly in half, while
also lowering methane emissions. However, further upscaling of
[MP]{.caps}, under the assumption of given consumer acceptance, results
in a non-linear saturation effect on reduced deforestation and related
[CO2]{.caps} emissions---an effect that cannot be captured with the
method of static [LCA]{.caps}.
