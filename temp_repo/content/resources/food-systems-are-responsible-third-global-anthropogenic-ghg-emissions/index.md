We have developed a new global food emissions database
([EDGAR]{.caps}-[FOOD]{.caps}) estimating greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.caps};
[CO2]{.caps}, [CH4]{.caps}, [N2O]{.caps}, fluorinated gases) emissions
for the years 1990--2015, building on the Emissions Database of Global
Atmospheric Research ([EDGAR]{.caps}), complemented with land
use/land-use change emissions from the [FAOSTAT]{.caps} emissions
database. [EDGAR]{.caps}-[FOOD]{.caps} provides a complete and
consistent database in time and space of [GHG]{.caps} emissions from the
global food system, from production to consumption, including
processing, transport and packaging. It responds to the lack of detailed
data for many countries by providing sectoral contributions to
food-system emissions that are essential for the design of effective
mitigation actions. In 2015, food-system emissions amounted to 18 Gt
[CO2]{.caps} equivalent per year globally, representing 34% of total
[GHG]{.caps} emissions. The largest contribution came from agriculture
and land use/land-use change activities (71%), with the remaining were
from supply chain activities: retail, transport, consumption, fuel
production, waste management, industrial processes and packaging.
Temporal trends and regional contributions of [GHG]{.caps} emissions
from the food system are also discussed.
