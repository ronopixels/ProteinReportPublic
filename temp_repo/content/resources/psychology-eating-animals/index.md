Most people both eat animals and care about animals. Research has begun
to examine the psychological processes that allow people to negotiate
this "meat paradox." To understand the psychology of eating animals, we
examine characteristics of the eaters (people), the eaten (animals), and
the eating (the behavior). People who value masculinity, enjoy meat and
do not see it as a moral issue, and find dominance and inequality
acceptable are most likely to consume animals. Perceiving animals as
highly dissimilar to humans and as lacking mental attributes, such as
the capacity for pain, also supports meat-eating. In addition to these
beliefs, values, and perceptions, the act of eating meat triggers
psychological processes that regulate negative emotions associated with
eating animals. We conclude by discussing the implications of this
research for understanding the psychology of morality.
