Driven by economic development and urbanisation, animal-based protein
([ABP]{.caps}) consumption has surged worldwide over the last 50. years,
rising from 61. g per person per day in 1961 to 80. g per person per day
in 2011. This contribution analyses the apparent convergence of dietary
models worldwide with respect to the proportion of [ABP]{.caps} and
especially meat in intake. By using [FAO]{.caps} data for 183 countries
over the period 1961-2011, the authors show the connection between
annual per capita [GDP]{.caps} and the level of [ABP]{.caps}
([R2]{.caps}. =. 0.62) and meat consumption ([R2]{.caps}. =. 0.62). They
emphasise the surge in [ABP]{.caps} intake in emerging countries (China,
Brazil) which has partly replaced plant protein. However, for similar
degrees of economic development, the composition of [ABP]{.caps}s and
the position of meat within this category vary significantly among
countries, suggesting that historical, geographical, cultural and
religious factors may beÂ involved.
