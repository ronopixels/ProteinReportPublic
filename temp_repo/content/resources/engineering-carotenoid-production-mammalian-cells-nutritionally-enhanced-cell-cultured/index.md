Metabolic engineering of mammalian cells has to-date focused primarily
on biopharmaceutical protein production or the manipulation of native
metabolic processes towards therapeutic aims. However, significant
potential exists for expanding these techniques to diverse applications
by looking across the taxonomic tree to bioactive metabolites not
synthesized in animals. Namely, cross-taxa metabolic engineering of
mammalian cells could offer value in applications ranging fromfood and
nutrition to regenerative medicine and gene therapy. Towards the former,
recent advances in meat production through cell culture suggest the
potential to produce meat with fine cellular control, where tuning
composition through cross-taxa metabolic engineering could enhance
nutrition and food-functionality. Here we demonstrate this possibility
by engineering primary bovine and immortalized murine muscle cells with
prokaryotic enzymes to endogenously produce the antioxidant carotenoids
phytoene, lycopene and β-carotene. These phytonutrients offer general
nutritive value and protective effects against diseases associated with
red and processed meat consumption, and so offer a promising
proof-of-concept for nutritional engineering in cultured meat. We
demonstrate the phenotypic integrity of engineered cells, the ability to
tune carotenoid yields, and the antioxidant functionality of these
compounds in vitro towards both nutrition and food-quality objectives.
Our results demonstrate the potential for tailoring the nutritional
profile of cultured meats. They further lay a foundation for
heterologous metabolic engineering of mammalian cells for applications
outside of the clinical realm.
