***Biotech is not inherently neutral, but we can design it to be fair***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the coming of every technological revolution lies the promise of a
better life for everyone. The Industrial Revolution led to lower prices,
more goods, and higher wages. The Scientific Revolution of the 20th
century dramatically improved the quality of life for countless people
through the development of vaccines and cures for various diseases, the
discovery of new forms of energy, and advances in industrial chemistry
that provided new materials for manufacturing thousands of products.
Most recently, the Digital Revolution enabled mass communication
worldwide and provided democratized access to a previously unimaginable
abundance of information, knowledge, and resources.

We are now at the dawn of an imminent Biological Revolution that
promises to be the most important technological revolution to date, with
the potential to impact all areas of our lives, from health to food,
climate, manufacturing, and much more. But even with all of the hype
coming from bioenthusiasts, the enormous amount of research being
conducted every year, and the billions of dollars being poured into
biotechnologies, there's still another side of the coin we need
to consider.

Yes, technological revolutions usually leave societies better off than
they were before, but that's never without some collateral damage. The
Industrial Revolution, for instance, was the catalyst for [massive
population
growth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/modernization/Population-change)
thanks to the overall improved quality of life that the new technologies
brought, but at the same time, it involved [child labor and inhumane
working
conditions](https://www.britannica.com/story/the-rise-of-the-machines-pros-and-cons-of-the-industrial-revolution)
and initiated a surge in [global greenhouse gas
emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?country=~OWID_WRL)
that continues to this day.

In the case of the Biological Revolution, the primary concerns are
usually related to biosecurity and the misuse of biotechnologies to
deliberately cause harm. There are also worries about the ethical
considerations of using technologies like CRISPR for human genetic
enhancement and the possible ecological consequences of the use of GMOs.
But there's something missing.

The general assumption is that technology is intrinsically neutral ---
it can be used for either good or bad and the outcome depends on the
person or group who uses it. However, history has shown us time and time
again that this is not entirely true.

**Biased from the start**

Biases are to humans what colors are to a rainbow. They are inherent to
people and even though we can endeavor to become conscious of them, we
can never totally get rid of them. Our biases shape the way that we
think and ultimately the decisions that we make. Furthermore, biases are
shaped by the context, culture, and values that surround us.

This means that when a technology is conceived or designed it will
ultimately be a reflection of these biases. They may be unconscious or
unintended by the people who created the technology, but in the end they
are there.

Let's take for example a seemingly harmless piece of technology: a
bridge. During the early to mid-20th century, [Robert
Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses) served as an urban
planner for the New York metropolitan area. By overseeing the
construction of parks, highways, tunnels, and much more, he was
responsible for creating many of the city's most iconic features. Yet
the urban planning and infrastructure design were heavily influenced by
Moses' racist views. This can be seen in [bridges that were purposefully
designed](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/05/887386869/how-transportation-racism-shaped-america)
to be so low that buses wouldn't be able to pass under them, only cars.
Because poor minorities were the ones that most commonly used public
transportation, this prevented them from reaching Long Island's beaches,
allowing only those rich enough to afford a car to pass underneath.

Next, let's take a look at what we could consider somewhat of a more
unconscious bias: a "racist" soap dispenser that only works for white
people. I seriously doubt that the designers of the automatic soap
dispenser purposefully designed it to work this way. Instead, what most
probably happened is that the dispenser was designed under the fair
assumption that if you send a beam of infrared light from an LED, this
will be reflected by the user's hand and send a signal to the mechanism
to dispense the soap. The thing is that the designers didn't take into
account the entire spectrum of people who would end up using the
dispenser, including individuals with a darker skin color that absorbs
the light instead of reflecting it.

The bottom line here is that technology is not neutral by default. It
comes with biases and flaws that are a direct result of their creator's
context, values, and even the things they inadvertently omit.
Ultimately, when considering the uses and applications of a technology,
we should also take into account human biases and the responsibility and
context of the designer because technology will always bring burdens
along with the blessings whether we want it or not.

Also, the greater the impact of a technology, the greater its negative
consequences will be.

**Who will nature serve?**

OK. Now back to biotech.

The biotech world also has its fair share of examples where biases,
values, and context have shaped the use and/or design of a technology:

-   The [overrepresentation of white
    individuals](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10020290) during
    clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines.
-   The fact that most (\>75%) of the sequenced genomes we use to study
    human health and diseases originate from [white
    individuals](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.1854) of
    [European descent](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.051), even
    though this ethnic group accounts for [only 16% of the global
    population](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0394-y).
-   Monsanto developing pesticide-resistant GMO seeds only to end up
    extorting the same farmers it was supposed to help and becoming a
    [monopoly that controls the world's food
    supply](https://fortune.com/2014/06/26/monsanto-gmo-crops/) (80% of
    U.S. corn and \>90% of U.S. soybeans are grown with
    Monsanto's seeds).
-   Biomanufactured insulin [increasing in price by 600% over the last
    20
    years](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/12/1122311443/insulin-costs-increased-600-over-the-last-20-years-states-aim-to-curb-the-price),
    despite technological improvements meaning that a vial of human
    insulin now [costs only \$2.28 to \$3.42 to
    produce](https://www.businessinsider.com/insulin-prices-could-be-much-lower-and-drug-makers-would-still-make-healthy-profits-2018-9?r=MX&IR=T).
    All a planned effort by the oligopoly of companies that control
    supply to increase profits at all costs, knowing that it's a matter
    of life or death to the people who need insulin and they will
    ultimately pay whatever it costs.

I believe that this is the real dark side of the Biological Revolution.
Yes, biotechnologies will likely have more of a positive impact on
society than anything else. But if we fail to recognize the hidden
biases and interests behind the use of biotech, its promises will
benefit only a handful of people.

What happens if we allow biomanufacturing to develop under the values,
culture, and biases of current extractive capitalism?

We could potentially produce as much as [60% of the physical inputs of
our global
economy](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/the-bio-revolution-innovations-transforming-economies-societies-and-our-lives)
using biology, but what if a select few corporations end up capturing
this technology with the ultimate goal of increasing their profits and
share values?

Biotech promises to increase longevity and cure all manner of diseases,
but what if living longer is only accessible to the billionaires of the
world and new drugs for diseases are only administered to the
most privileged?

The Biological Revolution won't make miracles by itself --- it depends
on the people who build it, and it's our responsibility to guide it
through a new system that primarily values people (from all backgrounds
and places) and the planet. Otherwise, biotech may become only a tool to
perpetuate the status quo.

**Integrating all voices into the equation**

So how do we build a Biological Revolution that takes everyone into
account, minimizes the influence of biases, and ultimately delivers a
better future for all? I owe you that one for now.

I don't think that there's a definitive answer, but a starting point
would be to allow distributed access to biotechnologies (including
knowledge, infrastructure, and ultimately the products and services that
the bioeconomy delivers). This would prevent them from becoming
centralized technologies available only in a few rich countries and
amplifying the already large inequalities.

The great thing about biotechnologies is that [they enable local
economies](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/p/atoms-are-local). And as
more people from all around the world join the Biological Revolution,
the greater diversity of thoughts and contexts we'll have to minimize
the risk of biases tilting the benefits of biotech toward particular
segments of the population. Ultimately each community could adapt each
technology to better serve their particular requirements, but this will
only be possible if they have access to it in the first place.

Another key point would be to integrate responsibility as a fundamental
part of the technology design process. In [her TED
Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIhxl9MF9-0), Cristina Zaga
discussed six key principles for designing tech responsibly:

-   Assess the values of your technology --- including your own values
    and those of the people you are working for and with.
-   Analyze the impact of the technology before you bring it to society.
-   Seek out and listen to a diverse range of voices during the
    design process.
-   Assess the power structures impacting the technology, as well as the
    privileges and economic driving forces behind it.
-   Design technology for social justice and equality.
-   Design for diversity and inclusiveness.

Fortunately, the Biological Revolution is already starting to take these
principles into account. A great example would be the [iGEM
Competition](https://competition.igem.org/), where thousands of students
worldwide work on synthetic biology projects that aim to solve local
problems in their communities. Teams are required to assess
responsibility from the conception of their project, including possible
biosafety hazards and the impacts it will have on all stakeholders.

Of course, responsible design and globalized access won't completely
prevent the misuse of biotechnologies --- again, all technology comes
with both blessings and burdens. However, they set the path that enables
a more sustainable and equitable world for all.

There is no doubt that the world won't be the same after the Biological
Revolution, and this is only the beginning, so we had better design it
to be fair.
