What I've learned through my first eleven *Brave New Meat* podcast
interviews with founders and investors in the cultivated meat industry

Last year an article in *Rolling Stone* magazine caught my eye: "[Would
You Eat a Lab-Grown Duck Breast? Inside the Alternate Meat
Industry."](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/alternate-meat-industry-fate-food-book-amanda-little-843545/)
It was an excerpt from a book by Amanda Little, *The Fate of Food: What
We'll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World*. She described the
experience of eating lab-grown duck from a startup I'd never heard of in
an industry I didn't know existed. That startup was Memphis Meats and I
fell down the rabbit hole of cultivated meat. At the time I thought, and
now am firmly convinced, that this technology will change the world.

I started the [*Brave New Meat*](https://bravenewmeat.buzzsprout.com/)
podcast to tell the stories of entrepreneurs and investors trailblazing
this new frontier. As of this writing, I'm eleven episodes in, and I've
never seen such a passionate cohort. These founders are motivated by and
rooted in their personal, moral convictions to make the world a
better place.

Additionally, through these conversations patterns have emerged about
the present state and future of the cultivated meat industry. Although
I'm sure my thoughts will continue to evolve, here are some of my
current observations relevant to startups in the space.

**Decentralization Out of the Valley**

While many of the early American cultivated meat companies followed the
tradition of software tech by starting in northern California (e.g.,
Memphis Meats, New Age Meats, Finless Foods), this trend seems to have
less influence on more recent entrants.

Cultured Decadence, for instance, is developing cell-based crustacean
meat. Both of the startup's founders are Bay Area cultivated meat
veterans, but opted to start their company in Madison, Wisconsin. [John
Pattison, CEO and co-founder
said](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/john-pattison-ian-johnson-co-founders-cultured-decadence/id1531974488?i=1000503515147),
"When we were looking at different locations to base the company, we did
an in-depth analysis of an ideal environment and ecosystem to start a
company and successfully grow and scale that business." They had three
major criteria: 1) local biotech talent pipeline; 2) potential partners
in food and biotech; 3) environment to efficiently deploy investor
capital. Madison delivered on all three and the team is now operating
out of [Forward Biolabs](https://www.forwardbiolabs.org/), a co-working
life science lab for startups.

Farther south in North Carolina, Mariliis Holm and Ryan Bethencourt
launched their VC fund, [Sustainable Food
Ventures](https://www.sustainablefoodventures.com/), in 2020. They are
also veterans of the Bay Area biotech industry, but decided to relocate
to the Southeast. When Mariliis was on the
[podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mariliis-holm-co-founder-sustainable-food-ventures/id1531974488?i=1000499324829),
she highlighted the advantages of North Carolina's [Research Triange
Park](https://www.rtp.org/) (RTP), which leads the nation in
affordability of the four major biotech research hubs (San Francisco,
San Diego, and Boston). She went on to say, "RTP is such an interesting
place ... it has a lot to offer as an ecosystem." As a biotech hub, in
addition to affordability there is a plethora of local talent in large
companies, but not a lot of startup activity relative to the other hubs.
However, several of SFVs portfolio companies have recognized the
opportunity and plan to relocate to Research Triangle in the future.
North Carolina seems to be an increasingly attractive potential home for
entrepreneurs looking to launch their cultivated meat startup.

Going forward into 2021, this decentralization will likely be
accelerated by the broader trend seen during COVID-19, with teams more
distributed and companies abandoning the pressure and and high costs of
living and operating in the Bay Area and other expensive cities.
Employees value quality of life, space, and affordability. Cultivated
meat startups were already ahead of this curve, and there doesn't seem
to be a compelling case to reverse course.

**Singapore Shining**

Even before Eat Just received regulatory approval and launched their
product at the [Singapore restaurant
1880](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lab-grown-meat-debut-1880-robertson-quay-eat-just-13782904),
Singapore was already a major player in the cultivated meat space. In
addition to being the home of Shiok Meats and Turtle Tree Labs, which
have raised [US\$20
million](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shiok-meats) and
[US\$9.4
million](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/turtletree-labs),
respectively, the government launched a US\$21 million
"[30x30Express](https://agfundernews.com/as-supply-chains-feel-the-strain-singapore-launches-21m-30x30-express-grant.html)"
grant program to boost local food production technologies. Singapore is
especially conscious of supply chains as it imports 90% of its food.

Singapore has come up in almost every podcast episode interview as an
early adopter country. In my
[interview](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lisa-feria-ceo-stray-dog-capital/id1531974488?i=1000499945381)
with Lisa Feria of Stray Dog Capital, she expanded on the Singapore
government's active engagement with cultivated meat startups her firm
has invested in.

> *Singapore as a country has been very opening and inviting and wants
> to partner with cultivated meat companies ... Our existing portfolio
> companies, almost all of them, are talking to the Singapore government
> to have Singapore to be among the first places they produce.*
>
> --- Lisa Feria, Stray Dog Capital

**Contrarian View**

I often ask guests what contrarian view they have of the industry.
Here's mine --- I believe regulatory showstoppers are overstated
compared to technical challenges in scaling these products at an
affordable price. Whenever the subject of the biggest challenge comes
up, many tend to mention regulatory concerns first, technical challenges
second. However, as illustrated by Singapore's approval, there are
governments that recognize the need to promote this technology and
ensure food security.

In Israel, a story similar to the one in Singapore is unfolding. Aleph
Farm's made
[history](https://www.gfi.org/blog-cultivated-meat-tasting-israel) in
December of 2020 when they served Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
cultivated steak, making him the first head of state to taste a
cultivated meat product. Not only did he enjoy the experience, he is
actively supporting growing the industry in Israel.

> *It's delicious and guilt-free, I can't taste the difference. I have
> directed the State Secretary Tzahi Braverman to appoint a body to
> serve these industries in order to connect and oversee all the
> stakeholders operating in this field. Israel will become a powerhouse
> for alternative meat and alternative protein.*
>
> --- Benjamin Netanyahu

Bruce Friedrich, executive director of The Good Food Institute, [noted
this occasion by
saying](https://www.gfi.org/israels_prime_minister_tastes_cultivated_steak),
"The Israeli government has turned the country into a nerve center for
plant-based and cultivated meat innovation." GFI works in both Israel
and the US to [advance regulatory
approval](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/412388-how-the-united-states-can-remain-a-world-leader-in-agriculture)
of cultivated meat and the US doesn't appear to be far behind. GFI's
efforts, coupled with the rest of the industry, [led to a framework in
2019](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/03/07/usda-and-fda-announce-formal-agreement-regulate-cell-cultured-food)
by the USDA and FDA for regulating the sector.

However, the technical costs of bringing down cultivated meat prices
remains a challenge, as evidenced by startups whose initial strategy was
to vertically integrate and build in-house but have pivoted to
specialize in critical components of the supply chain. As Lejjy Gafour,
CEO of [Future Fields explained to
me](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jalene-matt-anderson-baron-lejjy-gafour-co-founders/id1531974488?i=1000500624665),
"We started as a consumer facing company with the hardest goal
possible --- to make chicken, which is the cheapest meat, using these
techniques." They have since pivoted to a B2B strategy developing growth
media for companies making the cultivated meat products.

But with challenge comes opportunity and the B2B strategy seems to be
the most viable, especially for new entrants seeking to avoid
competition against multiple well funded teams with a several year
head-start on beef and pork products, such as Mosa Meats, Aleph, Super
Meat, and New Age Meats.

**Initial Belief I've Changed --- Winner Take All**

When I started the podcast, I assumed one winner would emerge as
essentially the Google of cultivated meat. I now believe there are many
niches to fill throughout the supply chain from ingredients and
components to end-consumer products.

On the B2B side, different meat products obviously require cell lines of
different species, but that's merely the tip of the iceberg. There are
numerous approaches to scaffolding and bioreactor design with
requirements that vary species to species. Similarly, there are
different requirements for culture media between species. Many of the
current supply chain solutions are focused on beef, pork, and chicken,
but fish and crustaceans will require unique inputs.

For end-consumer products there is a huge opportunity for geographical
differentiation. Although several companies are well capitalized with
maturing products, they are located in only a handful of countries.
However, most countries will be incentivized to follow the lead of
Singapore and Israel to develop their own production capability for food
security. Mariliis Holm described a future in which countries would
strive "to be to be self-sufficient in terms of food supply ... and a
cuisine, cultural, and location-based production and food system."
Cultivated meat technology promises to give an incredible variety of
products to countries and regions that historically have relied on
imports to feed their populations.

While the future is far from clear, it is dynamic and exciting. One
would be hard pressed to find an industry that will have more positive
impact in our lifetime. The educational resources and networking
opportunities provided by
[GFI](https://www.gfi.org/resources.php?audience-page=entrepreneurs) and
[New Harvest](https://new-harvest.org/what-is-cellular-agriculture/) are
valuable tools for those seeking to launch a startup or career in
cultivated meat.
