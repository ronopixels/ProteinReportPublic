An aquaculture researcher from the University of the Sunshine Coast
(USC) has secured a seed grant from US-based research institute New
Harvest to develop cell-based crayfish meat.

The grant recipient, Lisa Musgrove, will be using the funds to
investigate crayfish growth factors and cell culture during her Honours
degree in 2021, under the supervision of USC GeneCology Research Centre
scientist, Dr. Tomer Ventura. Musgrove will be the first Australian to
receive a grant from New Harvest, one of the only sources for funding
academic research in cellular agriculture.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of
industrial animal agriculture. The emerging research field of cellular
agriculture is dedicated to developing animal products (such as meat,
eggs, and dairy) directly from cells rather than living animals. This
novel food production method is projected to be more sustainable than
conventional animal agriculture by decreasing the amount of land, raw
materials, and energy required to produce meat.

There are currently ten cellular agriculture companies around the world
focusing on developing cell-based seafood. "Compared to many land-based
species, there is a relative lack of crustacean-related data, and there
are no published crustacean cell lines. We're aiming to address this
shortfall," says Musgrove.

Their research project will focus on the regenerating limb buds of
Redclaw crayfish, a freshwater crayfish native to parts of northern
Australia and Papua New Guinea. Redclaws are marketed as a premium
seafood product and are known for their sweet, delicate flavor and high
meat yield.

"The ultimate goal will be to find the factors and protocols needed to
make the cells proliferate and differentiate into muscle, potentially
leading to a myogenic crustacean cell line." says Musgrove. Musgrove and
Dr. Ventura believe the limb buds represent a unique opportunity to
characterize the growth factors involved in muscle development and also
to source muscle stem cells for sustainable meat production.

So far, the Ventura laboratory has successfully identified the Redclaw
orthologs of all the major growth factors and are now focusing on stem
cell isolation and culture.

Musgrove is also a volunteer at Cellular Agriculture Australia, a
nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and accelerating research
and development in the Australian cellular agriculture sector.
