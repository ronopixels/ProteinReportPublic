A growing number of entrepreneurs challenge the assumption that meat
eating will expand as industrializing countries amass wealth and seek
protein-rich diets. Most attention has been on the innovators producing
protein-rich alternatives, particularly plant-based and cell-based
options. Sales of [plant-based
proteins](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/04/06/How-is-coronavirus-impacting-plant-based-meat-Impossible-Foods-weighs-in),
for example, totaled \$5 billion in 2019 and climbed 158 percent in
2020. Financial firm UBS predicts that the U.S. market will grow to \$85
billion by 2030, and

magazine suggests that plant-based meat "has officially reached 'global
phenomenon' status."

Less recognized are the innovators developing serums and mixes in which
cell- and plant-based proteins can grow. Some of the most creative are
using ancient and simple components---including algae and mycelia---to
create the foundations for animal protein alternatives.

Algae, the planet's original singled-celled living organism, already
undergirds cosmetic creams, flavorings, colorants, ice creams, and
vitamin supplements---which have become a \$5-billion industry. Leonard
Lerer, founder and CEO of Back of the Yards Algae Sciences, envisions a
significantly larger market for algae with meat alternatives.

Taking a jab at the Western diet's dependence on cattle and pork, Lerer
named his firm after the Union Stock Yards once located in southern
Chicago and featured in Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle*. Back of the Yards
Algae Sciences, in fact, is one of several food-based start-ups located
within a 100,000 square-foot former meatpacking facility. "The meat of
hundreds of millions of pigs was probably processed in here," [explains
Lerer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/climate/circular-food-economy-sustainable.html).
"And soon we will be able to make a burger that is 100 percent
algae-based and cruelty-free." According to the CEO, the building has
gone full circle as a center for food innovation, starting early in the
20th century when it launched canning, cold storage, and industrialized
meat production. Today, while it maintains the smoke-stained bricks from
its former pork production, the structure serves as a laboratory for
alternative proteins, while large-scale production of
algae/mycelia-based colorants, feed, and food is done at a facility
in Utah.

Algae, which Lerer calls "the source of life," enjoy numerous
attributes. They grow ten times faster than soybeans, and they need a
tenth of the land to produce the same amount of plant material. They
thrive virtually anywhere, including non-productive and non-arable
lands, with multiple yields throughout the year, and they do not compete
with other crops for soil. They produce no waste materials. Pound for
pound, they contain twice the protein of meat, more beta-carotene than
carrots, more iron than spinach, and substantial amounts of omega-3
acids. Farming algae does not cause erosion or require synthetic
fertilizers or pesticides. The organisms do not even demand fresh water,
with the protists being quite happy in brackish, sea, or wastewater.

Algae help solve several of our greatest population and environmental
challenges. Rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins, they fortify food
and combat malnutrition among a growing population. Lerer increasingly
mixes algae with mycelia, the thread-like filaments from mushrooms and
other fungi. He admits that algae-as-a-feedstock has been hyped
previously but suffered two setbacks during the second half of the
twentieth century. In the 1950s, researchers touted *Chlorella
pyrenoidosa* as a solution to global malnutrition, with the United
Nations suggesting it was "the most ideal food for mankind" and the Food
and Agriculture Organization calling it "the best food for tomorrow."
Yet [no one mastered](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3106856) making
*Chlorella* economically on a large scale. During the first oil crisis
in the early 1970s, investors tried to convert algae into a biofuel that
would replace gasoline, but, again, the process proved to be
too expensive.

Lerer, however, argues algal science has progressed substantially and
the combination of global warming and population growth creates a new
imperative. He believes the biggest potential is not in the best-known
algae, such as seaweeds and spirulina, the dried blue-green organism
that is a common dietary supplement and food additive. More promising is
growing algae as the bedrock of sustainable, plant-based and cell-based
food industries that produce protein-rich alternatives to meat.

Lerer uses his biodigester's mixture to develop a serum in which
cultured meats grow. "We want to work towards a future where a leftover
piece of food could turn into the meat we would eat tomorrow," one of
Lerer's colleagues explains. "This is why we are focused on developing
an [algal stimulant to help cell-based
products](https://agfundernews.com/afn-introduces-singene-and-back-of-the-yards-algae-sciences.html)
grow faster, get more yield, better shelf life, and flavor." Lerer also
develops algae-based heme that could serve as the foundation for
plant-based meat substitutes, such as those produced by Impossible Foods
or Beyond Meat.

Lerer's latest targets are vertical farms, those indoor plant factories
that optimize environmental conditions, nutrition, and lighting. Such
sophisticated greenhouses allow food to be grown locally, reducing the
need for transcontinental shipping, and limiting the use of chemical
pesticides. After two years of research, Lerer discovered how to create
an extract from a blue-green algae---specifically the protein-pigment
complex, known as phycocyanin, that regulates photosynthesis in the
algae---to stimulate the produce's growth, yield, and quality. The
[bio-stimulant](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202011.0354/v1)
reduced maturation times by 21 percent, produced 12.5 percent more
protein-rich produce, and postponed wilting by several days. According
to Lerer, the algae extract "gives vertical farmers a new avenue for
reducing costs, while improving produce's color, vigor, nutrient
content, and preservation."

Algae refer to a broad collection of organisms, perhaps more than
one-million varieties, of which only 60,000 have been studied and just
20 used in modern food chains. "There's so much untapped potential,"
says Lerer. Depending on what he's trying to produce---such as
cultured-meat serum or heme for plant-based meats---the entrepreneur
uses microscopy and metabolite analysis to select the most appropriate
algal and mycelia strains, and he breeds different eukaryotic organisms
to optimize his outputs.

Lerer admits meat consumption could soar, as evidenced by the average
Chinese consumer increasing [meat
intake](https://www.economist.com/international/2019/05/04/global-meat-eating-is-on-the-rise-bringing-surprising-benefits)
from nine pounds in 1961 to 137 pounds in 2013, with larger boosts
occurring in Thailand, Brazil, and Morocco. Yet he believes alternatives
will accelerate---thereby improving animal welfare, environmental
quality, and health---but only if plant- and cell-based producers obtain
better blends in which to grow their proteins. Fortunately, modern
scientists are repositioning basic organisms to help meat
substitutes thrive.
