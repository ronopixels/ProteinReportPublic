"The thing about the cellular agriculture supply chain is that there
isn't one," says Dalhousie University Ph.D. candidate, Dawne Skinner.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Skinner is a New Harvest
Research Fellow whose [research focuses
on](https://new-harvest.org/people/?direct-link=60c372803e839)
identifying opportunities for the cellular agriculture industry to apply
circular economy interventions to its processes.

This economic sustainability paradigm, also sometimes referred to as a
closed-loop system, is focused on designing waste out of the economy,
keeping materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. According to
the [Ellen MacArthur
Foundation](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept),
decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources
can improve the triple bottom line --- the social, environmental, and
financial outcomes of our economic system.

"Many other industries use a linear model --- take, make, use, and
dispose --- which is clearly unsustainable. Once a supply chain is
established," says Skinner, "it is essentially locked in because it is
too costly to reconfigure. Given that the cell-based industry is
nascent, we are in the stage of initiating a new supply chain. My
research aims to figure out how we can start this supply chain off on
the right foot."

Skinner's work is particularly noteworthy because, as an environmental
engineer and consultant who recently completed an MBA in Innovation,
Enterprise, and the Circular Economy, she brings a fresh perspective to
a field dominated by those with a biotech background.

That industry focus on biotech isn't surprising given that the majority
of cellular agriculture research and development (R&D) leverages the
pharmaceutical supply chain. "Pharmaceutical-grade applications have
higher purities than food-grade applications, which incurs many
additional costs in the production of cell-based products," says
Skinner. "This could be overcome, in part, with a more appropriate
approach to inputs and outputs."

In other words, where any opportunities exist to produce culture media
from non-pharmaceutical-grade inputs, the industry can, in theory,
[dramatically drive
down](https://gfi.org/resource/analyzing-cell-culture-medium-costs/) not
only the R&D costs but those passed along to the consumer as well,
making the future of cellular agriculture much more viable. And while
proponents of cell ag suggest that the technology has the potential to
eliminate many of the adverse environmental outcomes associated with
conventional animal production, preliminary life-cycle analyses
[suggest](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26383898/) that the technology
isn\'t inherently superior across all sustainability metrics --- due to
its higher energy, wastewater processing, and feedstock requirements.

As Skinner noted in her New Harvest application, though, the purpose of
her project "is to identify opportunities for this budding sector to
leverage the potential triple-bottom-line benefits of
closed-loop/circular economy production systems and supply chains
\[\...\] to gain competitive advantage, improve sustainability, and to
model/optimize such a system." In innovation, there's hope. A [2017
study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306095192_Closing_loops_in_agricultural_supply_chains_using_multi-objective_optimization_A_case_study_of_an_industrial_mushroom_supply_chain),
for instance, suggests that adopting a closed-loop supply chain in
agricultural production resulted in an 11% increase in profitability and
a 28% improvement in environmental outcomes.

Skinner's research, very much in line with these goals, will take the
form of a case study. "We first need to build a model based on existing
knowledge and processes. Once we get the model built and validated, we
will be looking for data from companies who are working on the same
product to run through the model and record how much of an improvement
there is. We have not yet reached out to companies, but we are hoping to
get ones who are at the stage where they are thinking about building
their facilities and processes so we can help maximize potential."

Skinner's background is in industrial and environmental engineering and,
as the owner of Net Positive Solutions Consulting, which is focused on
empowering mission-driven and non-profit organizations, she was looking
for opportunities to combine engineering with sustainability. "My
passion lies in animal welfare, and when I heard about cellular
agriculture, I thought about how I could apply my skills to advance the
field. Meat production comes with a host of environmental, social, and
ethical dilemmas, and I aligned with cell ag's principle of changing the
means of production rather than the product itself."

This approach parallels the circular economy's macro-level emphasis on
systems change, rather than homing in on incremental fixes or relying on
individual austerity. "We've been beating consumers over the head with
the concept of sustainability for the past 25 years or so, and we are
actually worse off. If we can make systemic adjustments, rather than
demanding change of individuals, that is less sacrifice on the part of
the consumer and thus longer-lasting change."

For too long, sustainability has been framed as binary in opposition to
convenience or as a liability to economic interests --- but within a
functioning circular economy, Skinner emphasizes that these realities
can coexist. "The key is shifting away from something that is
unsustainable while at the same time improving the economy's triple
bottom line. This could enable developing countries to leapfrog into a
less environmentally intensive future and help developed countries to
provide new opportunities to companies. Whenever systems change, there
is opportunity to include people that have previously been
underrepresented."
