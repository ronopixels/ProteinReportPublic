Three late-stage PhD candidates from Western Australian universities
have been accepted into an industry internship program to undertake
cultivated meat research. The internships are funded by the Government
of Western Australia, a first for the Australian cellular agriculture
sector.

The seven-week iPREP WA (Industry and PhD Research Engagement Program)
will take place at [Cass
Materials](https://www.proteinreport.org/directory/cass-materials), a
cellular agriculture startup based in Perth creating an affordable and
edible cellulose-based scaffold for cultivated meat production. The
emerging research field of cellular agriculture is dedicated to
producing meat and other animal products (such as eggs and dairy)
without the need for conventional animal agriculture. This technology
could have significant potential implications for environmental
sustainability, animal welfare, biodiversity, and human health.

The project will involve growing meat cells on Cass Materials\'
proprietary ingredient derived from nata de coco cellulose, and
researching the socio-environmental impacts of scaling its production.

Gary Cass, Founder of Cass Materials, says "It is wonderful to be part
of the iPREP WA program and gaining access to a diverse group of
near-graduating academic talent across all the Western Australia
universities. With our wide ranging sets of skills, both my company and
the iPREP interns can benefit from each other."

The three iPREP WA interns, Prathyusha Tangella, Tilsa Guima, and Thanh
Hoang, are currently working on individual projects including lab-based
research, consumer acceptance research, andÂ life cycle assessment of
cultivated meat production, under the guidance of Cass Materials and
[Cellular Agriculture
Australia](https://www.proteinreport.org/directory/cellular-agriculture-australia).

[iPREP WA](https://www.iprep.edu.au/) is a collaboration between the
five WA universities and provides scholarships for PhD candidates to
gain work experience with industry startups, SMEs, or large
corporations.

"We are excited to partner with an innovative start-up like Cass
Materials to help contribute to the associated socio-environmental
issues in the global food market," says Narelle Jones, iPREP WA
coordinator. "The project promotes new research and development
collaboration opportunities between universities and agribusiness by
exposing PhD candidates to cellular agriculture and industry practices.
We look forward to seeing the outcomes of the project!"

The partnership between iPREP and Cass Materials is funded under the
Agribusiness Tertiary Connect Grant from the Science and Agribusiness
Connect initiative. This initiative, developed by the Department of
Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, is aimed at building the
capability of Western Australia's agricultural science sector. iPREP WA
is currently taking expressions of interest from agribusinesses who
qualify for a funded project.
