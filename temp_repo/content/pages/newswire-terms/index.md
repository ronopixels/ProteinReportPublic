Protein Report publishes press releases on behalf of companies and organizations as a free service in accordance with its mandate to advance public understanding of how protein is produced, distributed, and consumed.

Protein Report is under no obligation to publish content submitted by users and reserves the right to refuse publication of any announcement at its sole discretion for any reason it sees fit.

Press releases that are primarily promotional in nature are likely to not be approved unless a significant portion of the content is of non-promotional news value such as scientific, industry, commercial, or policy developments or other topics relevant to our mission.

By agreeing to these terms and conditions, the company/organization grants Protein Report a worldwide, non-exclusive right to use their logos, trademarks, and tradenames for non-commercial use including, without limitation, the promotion of content on the Protein Report website, social media, mobile apps, and associated promotional events.

Protein Report makes all attempts to ensure the authenticity of each announcement published, but assumes no responsibility for the posting of fraudulent material. Organizations posting on Protein Report are responsible for ensuring that their work does not breach anti-plagiarism and/or copyright laws or guidelines. If an organization is deemed to have plagiarized content, they will be immediately and irrevocably banned from Protein Report.

Protein Report is not responsible for the use of published announcements by other parties, and encourages companies and organizations to monitor such unauthorized use of their announcements.

Protein Report reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice.
