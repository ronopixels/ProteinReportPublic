description: "New Wave Foods was founded in 2015 by Michelle Wolf (MS in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University) and Dominique Barnes (MS in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation from Scripps Institute of Oceanography). New Wave Foods is developing and perfecting the world’s only algae- and plant-based shrimp and is researching on further development (lobster, crab, salmon, and other seafood) by using natural ingredients and cutting-edge science. The result: seafood without slavery, bycatch, shellfish allergens, antibiotics, and ecosystem devastation – seafood  that everybody can love."
