description: "Cell Farm is developing & standardizing a biotechnological process to produce meat from animal stem cells avoiding raising cattle and its&nbsp;counterparts.By performing a non-invasive micro biopsy to the animal they obtain the stem cells, then proliferate and differentiate those cells into muscle and fat tissue mimicking the process as it would happen naturally in the&nbsp;animal."
