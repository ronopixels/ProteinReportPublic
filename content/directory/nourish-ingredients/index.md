description: "Nourish Ingredients knows that the best alternative foods need alternative fats: dairy, meat, and fish fats are unique. We create healthy, animal-free fats that taste and perform better than plant fats like coconut and palm. Our synbio tech is not locked by existing biology so we can explore new function and flavour spaces. Nourish is building tailored fats that are healthier for your customer and taste like the real thing. Cleaner, tastier, healthier fats."
