description: "A start-up, aiming to produce a viable, artificial blood circulation&nbsp;system.Their focus is on manufacturing blood for the manufactured meat industry. Manufactured meat has been demonstrated and eaten. It exists. However, it is still way too expensive and one reason for the high price of the meat is the use of lab-culture medium. The company aims to address this problem and provide real blood to the nascent manufactured meat industry instead. Manufactured real blood should make for a better taste&nbsp;too."
