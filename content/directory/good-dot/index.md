description: "Good Dot was born when a group of friends decided to come together for a common cause.They wanted to make the world a more humane place for animals.Having witnessed the unbelievable cruelty involved in animal agriculture, they decided to create a solution that was good for all.The GoodDot team believes that the main reason why most people eat meat is its taste. If a plant-based product could be created which not only tasted like meat but was an ethical, healthier, and environmentally sustainable alternative to animal meat, people would happily make the switch."
