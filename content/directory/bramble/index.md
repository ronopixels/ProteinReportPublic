description: "We know from our own diets that most commercial meat is full of pesticides, anti-biotics, growth hormones, carcinogens and other harmful contaminants. It’s making us sick and it’s making our pets sick, too. There’s a better way to feed our pets – and it’s better for the planet, too. Dogs love Bramble! And you can feel good about giving your pet complete and balanced, fresh plant-based food that is healthier for your pet, kinder to animals and overall better for the planet. Eat. Play. Love."
