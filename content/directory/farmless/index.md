description: "Farmless is a venture backed Dutch start-up that grows healthy food without arable land by turning renewable energy into food through fermentation. We select microbes for the potential food applications based on their functionality and nutritional value, and grow them in standard bioreactors. This process uses 10-100x less land than plant protein and 100-500x less than animal protein. The land that Farmless frees up can be given back to nature. Our product can become one of the cheapest scalable forms of protein for human consumption at scale in the next decade."
