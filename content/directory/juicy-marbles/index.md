description: "Our meats are not made in a lab, nor do we print them. We created our very own Meat-o-matic Reverse Grinder™ 9000. It mimics muscle texture by layering soy protein into linear fibers. It's a simple, 100% physical process using natural ingredients. The quality of protein is key for a good and nutritious steak, so we only source the good stuff."
