description: High protein flour from upcycled ingredients. PLANETARIANS’
  patent-pending technology adds value to overlooked ingredients like defatted
  seeds, converts them into a high-protein, high-fiber ingredient, and helps
  food manufacturers fortify a variety of food products with natural protein and
  fiber from seeds. Repurposing defatted sunflower seeds from animal to human
  consumption we demonstrate the potential of feeding growing population
  simultaneously reducing the impact on the planet.
