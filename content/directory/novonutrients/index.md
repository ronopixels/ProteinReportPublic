description: "NovoNutrients has a platform technology that turns carbon dioxide emissions into products. The focus is now making nutritious, customizable inputs for the food system. We have already started licensing technology to make large-scale systems that take in CO2 waste and (ideally, green) energy. The systems will make inputs for protein companies which themselves may make: multi-ingredient feeds for animals, plant-based “meats” for people, or meat from cultured animal cells."
