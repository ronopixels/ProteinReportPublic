description: "ORF Genetics is committed to developing innovative, economically viable and enabling solutions for the production of recombinant proteins in a more efficient, safer manner than other protein expression systems. ORF has developed the unique expression system Orfeus, which uses barley grain as a vehicle for recombinant protein production. Orfeus has been found to be particularly effective in expression of growth factors and cytokines."
