**Hamburg, November 17, 2022** --- Mushlabs, one of Europe's leading
companies in mycelium fermentation, has been included in Fast Company's
second annual [Next Big Things in
Tech](https://www.fastcompany.com/next-big-things-in-tech/list) list.
The list highlights technology breakthroughs that promise to shape the
future of industries - from agriculture and environment to productivity
and artificial intelligence. 83 technologies are included in the list
this year, from established companies, startups, and research teams from
around the globe. The cutting-edge advancements were selected based on
potential to impact consumers, businesses and society overall. While not
all of the technological developments are available in the market yet,
each one is reaching key milestones in order to have a proven impact in
the next five years.

Mushlabs is a young biotech company from Hamburg, Germany, creating the
next generation of sustainable food using fermentation and the power of
the fungal kingdom. The goal is to build a more sustainable and
resilient food system. To achieve this, the company cultivates the
mycelium of edible mushrooms in large metal tanks (so-called
fermenters). The harvested mycelium is processed in a few steps with a
handful of natural ingredients to create delicious substitute products.
Fermentation is one of the most efficient and sustainable food
production methods worldwide. Thanks to its high controllability, the
process only needs a fraction of the ressources and none of the
pesticides or fertilizers used for soy and meat production. Mushlabs
also developed a technique to utilize agrifood side streams to use as
feed for their mycelium. Another benefit: fermenters can be installed
and used anywhere in the world. That is why Mushlabs plans to build a
decentralized food production system, using local side streams and
cooperating with renowned partners to create delicious, sustainable and
healthy food products adapted to local habits and demands.

"The food system is out of balance. What we need are inclusive solutions
that transform the traditional food system and help consumers to make
healthier and more sustainable decisions. Mushlabs can offer the
technology to achieve that," says Dr. Mazen Rizk, founder and CEO of
Mushlabs.

"Technology breakthroughs and cutting-edge advancements promise to be
the solution to some of the world's most pressing issues. Fast Company
is excited to highlight some of the organizations, of all sizes and
industry backgrounds, whose technology advancements today will lead to a
better tomorrow," says Brendan Vaughan, editor-in-chief of Fast Company.
