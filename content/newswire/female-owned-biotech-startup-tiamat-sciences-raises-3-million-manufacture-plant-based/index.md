*Proprietary plant molecular farming platform to advance multiple
industries, including cellular agriculture, regenerative medicine, and
vaccine production*  

**Durham, North Carolina -- November 24th, 2021** -- Biotechnology
startup Tiamat Sciences today announced its \$3 million seed financing
round led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm True Ventures with
participation from Social Impact Capital and Cantos. Tiamat Sciences
manufactures animal-free proteins using a proprietary plant molecular
farming platform. By replacing costly bioreactors with plants, the
company produces key reagents for biotechnology companies at a fraction
of the cost.

Those reinvented biomolecules are used to fuel the next generation of
biotechnology innovations in various fields such as cellular agriculture
and cultivated meat, regenerative medicine, and novel vaccine
production. These new fields rely on reagents accounting for more than
80% of the production cost. But Tiamat offers key proteins 10X cheaper
than the current market offers with fermentation technologies.

"Our technology can help to promote animal-free alternatives not only
for food but also for the pharmaceutical industry," said
France-Emmanuelle Adil, founder and CEO of Tiamat Sciences. "Plants are
a great system to work with; they grow fast, are small water and energy
consumers, and they are compostable. The technology offers flexibility
with production for a diversified product portfolio."

The Tiamat team designed its proprietary production process by combining
biotechnology, vertical farming, and computation design to reinvent
recombinant proteins. While having already achieved a 10X cost decrease
for its current products with lab-scale practices, the company is
planning to achieve a cost decrease of 1,000X by 2025 with large-scale
production for a wide catalog of products.

With its two operating sites, in Belgium and the U.S., team Tiamat is
forging global partnerships and preparing its expansion to include
additional local production facilities. The company is already on its
way to reach carbon-neutral production. Those strategies will allow
Tiamat to reduce its environmental footprint and offer string supplies
in a field that has endured numerous raw material shortages over the
past several years.

"From regenerative medicine to cellular agriculture, numerous companies
are looking for animal-free solutions for their activities," said
Adil.** **"Our exclusive plant-based production system allows us to
answer those needs with a wide range of reagents. By targeting nascent
markets on the verge of scale-up, we've already demonstrated significant
traction for our solutions and an early revenue potential that is
outstanding for a biotech startup."

"Affordable animal-free growth factors are a long-awaited ingredient for
cellular-agriculture companies in their mission to bring cultured meats
to the market," said Ryan Bethencourt, CEO of Wild Earth and Tiamat
Science's chairman. "Thanks to its innovative production platform using
plants as bioreactors, I'm confident that the Tiamat team will address
both the price and scalability challenges on one of the most exciting
markets of the century."

"We follow best-in-class founders into the future as they invent the
missing pieces of their industries," said Phil Black, co-founder of True
Ventures. "This is absolutely the case with the Tiamat team. Their
innovations in cellular agriculture and biotechnology will advance
multiple industries and even the work of other companies in our
portfolio. We're here to play a supporting role in this exciting shift
to a more plant-based future."

To continue its work, Tiamat Sciences will build its pilot production
facility in prominent technology research center Research Triangle Park
in Durham, North Carolina.
