VANCOUVER, BC and SINGAPORE - April 6, 2021 --**  [**Eat Beyond Global
Holdings
Inc.**](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3119553-1&h=1018765622&u=https%3A%2F%2Featbeyondglobal.com%2F&a=Eat+Beyond+Global+Holdings+Inc.) **(CSE:
EATS) (OTCPK: EATBF) (FSE: 988) (\"**Eat Beyond**\" or the
\"**Company**\"), an investment issuer focused on the global plant-based
and alternative food sector, is announcing that its portfolio company
SingCell Tx Pte Ltd. (\"SingCell\") has entered into a technology
development agreement with the National University of Singapore to
evaluate and license its plant-based edible microcarriers technology.

\"The initial performance of these microcarriers in terms of cell
attachment and proliferation is very promising and could solve the cost
and scalability issues in the cultured meat industry,\" said Karolis
Rosickas, CEO of SingCell. \"This technology is very complementary to
SingCell\'s existing 3D cell culture technology, and soon we will be
able to offer a more comprehensive bioprocessing scale-up solution to
our clients.\"

SingCell operates as a contract development and manufacturing
organization (CDMO), offering its proprietary platform to third-party
alternative meat companies, which provides scalable processes for
cultured meat manufacturing. SingCell has a rapidly growing pipeline of
potential projects.

\"SingCell is focused on improving the feasibility of the cultured meat
industry by focusing purely on the cost and scalability of the
technology,\" said Eat Beyond CEO Patrick Morris. \"The company is also
located in Singapore, which is truly the epicenter of this industry and
was the first jurisdiction globally to approve cell based meat for
consumption.\"

The Singapore government has placed a major focus on innovation that
will drive food security and make the nation less dependent on foreign
suppliers. SingCell is well positioned to leverage these programs to
develop its technology and manufacturing infrastructure in Singapore.
