**Shanghai, 12 April 2021:** Starting from this month, partnerships
between Haofood, a startup creating peanut protein-based alternative
chicken, and five restaurants in Shanghai offering authentic dishes from
cultures around the globe unites tradition and modern technology to
bring customers a unique culinary experience.

"We want to unite the past, present, and future," says Haofood's CEO,
Astrid Prajogo. "The past being traditional menus by dedicated chefs,
the future being plant-based meat, and the present being customers'
experiences today." The five restaurants using Haofood's products to
revitalise their cultures' dishes are Green Friday (Xujiahui Station),
Topolino (Changping Rd Station), STYX (Hengshan Rd Station), Wrap and
Roll (Jiangsu Rd Station), and The Pawon (Yili Rd Station).

Each of Haofood's partners brings something unique to the table. Wrap
and Roll turns Haofood's chicken into practical, tasty, and healthy food
which can be incorporated into everyday life such as mini burger, wrap
and bowl. Green Friday, specialising in plant-based dishes, marries
popular Chinese dishes la zi ji and gong bao ji ding with peanut-based
chicken made using Haofood's products. The Pawon presents authentic
Indonesian chicken dishes sate ayam, ayam rendang, and dabu-dabu grilled
chicken. STYX brings to life memories of travelling through Southeast
Asia with dishes from their street food scene such as chicken satay,
chicken curry rice, chicken bites, and fusion tacos. Meanwhile, Topolino
offers a variety of authentic Sicilan comfort foods from pizza and pasta
to salads and paninis.

Prajogo describes one of Haofood's aims in working with these
restaurants as being part of their mission to make eating good food
forever possible. "We all know eating meat is less sustainable, but it's
an important part of so many traditional menus," she explains. "So
plant-based meat is one one of the ways to preserve this, because we can
continue our culinary heritage but also respect the Earth."
