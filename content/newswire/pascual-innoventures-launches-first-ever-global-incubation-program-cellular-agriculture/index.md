Pascual, a leading Spanish manufacturer of dairy products and beverages,
has launched Mylkcubator, the first global incubation program for
cellular agriculture technologies in the dairy industry. The program is
run by the group's new Corporate Venture unit, Pascual Innoventures, on
a mission to support innovative startups disrupting the dairy value
chain.

Pascual Innoventures aims to become an early stage investor,
accelerating and forging alliances with startups that share the same
purpose while also thriving as a corporation by launching its own
startups, with the objective of incorporating them into Pascual\'s
future business operations.

The first edition of Mylkcubator will last 6 months, from selection to
the demo day. The goal is to enroll 10 startups, entrepreneurs or
scientific projects, with innovative solutions in the cellular
agriculture spectrum for the dairy industry within the following
technologies: cell based, fermentation based and applied technologies.
All the details about the program are available on the official website
[mylkcubator.com.](http://mylkcubator.com)

Pascual Innoventures counts on the support of Eatable Adventures, one of
the top three global food-tech accelerators, deriving from their
continued strategic partnership after the first plant-based dairy
challenge launched in 2020.

According to the RethinkX report "Rethink Food and Agriculture
2020-2030", by 2030 almost 90% of U.S. dairy protein demand will come
from precision fermentation alternatives.

Solid protein (casein and whey) account for just 3,3% of milk's overall
composition, the 87,75% is made up of water and the rest is sugar
(mainly lactose), fats, vitamins and minerals.

The key to understanding the disruption of the dairy is that cellular
agriculture only needs to disrupt 3,3% of the milk bottle, attributed to
the key functional proteins.

Gabriel Torres Pascual, director of Pascual Innova and third generation
of the Pascual family is leading the new unit together with Sejal Ravji,
director of Pascual Innoventures, a biochemical engineer from UCL
(University College London) with a PhD in Rheology.

Sej began his career in Switzerland and France, worked in various
companies in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain, and also gained
experience as a strategic innovation consultant as well as co-founding a
FoodTech startup.

Gabriel Torres Pascual has worked for Google in New York and London,
holds an MBA from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and
completed a Master of Science at Imperial College London.

*\"The entrepreneurial, innovative spirit is in our genes, it comes from
the attitude that my grandfather instilled in us of being nonconformist,
dreaming big and daring to take risks, not only with our heads but also
with our hearts. This is how Pascual Innoventures was born with a
long-term vision and the purpose of giving the best for the future of
food. We will work hand in hand with startups that allow us to move into
the future\"* says Gabriel Torres.

In addition to this initiative, Pascual Innoventures is already working
on many other strategic projects, which seek to respond and provide
solutions to some of the major challenges in the agri-food sector, such
as food security, health & wellness, and circular economy.
