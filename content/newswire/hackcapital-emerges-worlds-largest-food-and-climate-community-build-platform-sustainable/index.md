*(Lausanne, Switzerland, May 30th, 2023)*
[HackCapital](https://www.hackcapital.co) launches out of stealth to
provide the investment platform to unlock billions in new capital
towards private companies working on impact solutions.

Powered by Co-Founders and industry angel investors, Arman Anatürk,
Camille Bossell and Emilie Dellecker, HackCapital enables Founders, Fund
Managers, and Syndicates across ClimateTech to easily raise capital from
their networks for their own raises.

30+ startups and funds have been enabled to pool capital into their
round and tap into HackCapital's investor network including
Austria-based Arkeon turning CO2 into functional, climate positive
ingredients, US-based Tandem Repeat creating a new generation of
self-healing biomaterials, and Israeli Bioraptor, a picks and shovel
startup leveraging AI to supercharge deeptech startups.

"HackCapital was created to address the biggest need of our community;
mobilising capital towards private companies and funds active in the
impact sector. We see ourselves as the enabler of the ecosystem, being
the financial platform behind the best founders and fund managers to
help them do more of what they do best," explains Arman Anatürk, CEO and
Co-Founder of HackCapital.

With the UN estimating that [\$5-7
trillion](https://www.unepfi.org/positive-impact-2/#:~:text=An%20estimated%20%245%2D7%20trillion,address%20the%20SDGs%20financing%20gap.)
is needed per year between 2015 and 2030 to achieve a set of SDGs
globally, HackCapital helps to bridge the funding gap by opening up a
new route of financing from small ticket accredited investors and
removing the traditional complexities associated with fundraising from
multiple investors across geographies.

Its current capabilities cover roll-up vehicles for founders raising
their next round, feeder funds for managers raising their next venture
fund and micro vehicles for first time asset managers looking to quickly
setup and deploy. These three solutions use automation and digitisation
to speed up, and reduce the cost, to raise and deploy meaningful capital
for builders and capital allocators working across sustainability and
health.

A recurring theme amongst the investments structured on HackCapital is
that they're all made alongside "industry leading venture firms" such as
US-based Siddhi Capital and Germany's FoodLabs - who were also early
investors in the company's pre-seed round last year.

When asked why they decided to build HackCapital, Co-Founder Emilie
responded "Truth is, we built HackCapital for ourselves first. We saw so
many great companies come through our doors and present their early
visions at our [HackSummit](https://www.hacksummit.co) events and
[Meetups](https://foodhack.global/events/meetups) which have gone on to
become some of the biggest successes in our industry. I wish back then I
had the means and the knowledge to write the first checks to these
founders - and I'm sure others in our community would have done so too".

Unlike similar investment tools that structure SPVs (Special Purpose
Vehicles) and which have a limitation on the number of investors,
HackCapital has built a novel EU-based structure that replaces the need
for SPVs altogether, significantly reducing the time and cost to pool
capital, and without limitation on the number of investors that can take
part.

Camille Bossel, Co-Founder of HackCapital, expressed the significance of
establishing a robust legal framework that surpasses industry standards.
"The primary objective was to create a structuring platform that offers
unparalleled flexibility without compromising security. After careful
consideration, Luxembourg was chosen as the ideal location for setting
up our investment platform. Luxembourg stands as the second leading fund
administration hub globally, following Delaware, and boasts a
digital-friendly environment. Moreover, its securitisation regulation we
operate under has the potential to revolutionise access to private
market impact investments."
