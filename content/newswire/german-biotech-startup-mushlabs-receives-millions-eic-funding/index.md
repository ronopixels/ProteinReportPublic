**EU invests in a safe and sustainable food system**

**Hamburg-based biotech startup Mushlabs has been selected for the EU\'s
prestigious EIC Accelerator program. More than 1,000 startups and small
businesses from Europe applied to receive a share of the €382 million in
total capital. 74 outstanding companies will now each receive funding of
up to 17.5 million Euros - with Mushlabs receiving an eight-digit
figure. Through the EIC Accelerator program, the EU aims to support
technology startups that address societal challenges and drive
breakthrough European innovations. This year, five companies from the
food sector are represented. For CEO and founder, Dr. Mazen Rizk,
Mushlabs' selection is a clear sign that Europe is focusing on ensuring
a safe and sustainable food supply.**

Hamburg, June 13, 2022 - German company Mushlabs is harnessing the power
of biotechnology to develop a new generation of sustainable food. The
production process is unique: instead of cultivating a mushroom fruiting
body, the mycelium (the root of the mushroom) is grown in a highly
efficient and time-saving process called fermentation. The resulting
ingredient serves as a new staple food and, thanks to its outstanding
properties, can be transformed into almost any food product with little
effort. At the same time, it has a significantly smaller ecological
footprint than soy or meat. Mushlabs\' vision is to create a
sustainable, healthy and fair food system - made in Europe.

Established in 2021 by the European Commission, the European Innovation
Council (EIC) is Europe\'s flagship innovation program to identify,
develop and disseminate breakthrough innovations across all technology
sectors, particularly the health, environment, and digital sectors.
Startups and small and medium-sized enterprises are supported by the
program, with only the most innovative companies selected through the
competitive and rigorous selection process by external experts,
investors, and entrepreneurs. In 2021, the first year of the EIC
Accelerator program, only 4% of projects were awarded funding. Decisive
criteria for selection are the provision of an innovative and
strategically relevant technology for Europe, a contribution to the
achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, excellent scale-up
potential, and a well-thought-out commercialization strategy. As part of
the EIC community, the selected companies will receive capital as well
as mentoring and access to investors and companies.

**Quote Dr. Mazen Rizk, CEO and Founder of Mushlabs:**\
"Our selection for the EIC Accelerator Program shows that the EU is
seriously addressing the sustainability and security issues in the food
sector. The looming food crisis and the ongoing devastating effects on
the environment make it abundantly clear how fragile our current system
is. Mushlabs uses biotechnology to tap into the full nutritional
potential of mycelium, the root of mushrooms. Using fermentation, we
cultivate a new staple food that has the potential to feed the world.
New technologies like this make it possible to build a fairer,
decentralized, and sustainable food system. We want to lead this
revolution in Europe and take it into the world. Support programs such
as the EIC Accelerator strengthen Europe as an innovation site and
secure promising technologies for its own markets. To become even more
competitive, the EU can and must do more - for example, in accelerating
regulatory and approval processes. Here we are already behind other
competitor regions.\"

**Comment from the EIC Jury:**\
"The jury believes that the European Union needs to support companies
with unique and strategic technology to produce sustainable alternative
protein based on a circular model. This is a break-through technology
born in Europe that can impact the alternatives to the animal protein
market with clean and less processed final food products. The project is
addressing several SDGs with positive impact on land, water and energy
usage. The team is business savvy, ambitious, adapts quickly, coachable
and has complimentary skills needed to implement the technology and the
scale-up."
