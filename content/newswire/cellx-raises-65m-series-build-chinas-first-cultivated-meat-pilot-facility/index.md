-   This new round of funding will aid CellX\'s move towards pilot scale
    production of its cultivated meat products. To date, CellX has
    raised above \$20M, making it China\'s most funded cultivated meat
    startup. 
-   CellX has completed China\'s first pilot production facility with
    capacity for multiple 2,000L bioreactors. The expected annual
    production capacity will reach tons. This is a major milestone to
    signal that CellX and the Chinese cultivated meat industry have
    entered the era of pilot production at scale.
-   CellX has successfully completed the development of more than ten
    cell lines from various species, a few of which have been adapted to
    grow in suspension in serum free media, and the leading cell line
    has entered the pilot stage.

**Shanghai, June 25, 2023** --- Chinese leading cellular agriculture
company CellX raised \$6.5M in its Series A+ funding. This new round is
led by multiple strategic investors, and it will aid CellX\'s move
towards pilot scale production of its cultivated meat products. To date,
CellX has raised over \$20M in total, making it China\'s most funded
cellular agriculture startup.

Founded in 2020, CellX has built R&D platforms across the four major
technological pillars of cultivated meat, cell line development, media
optimization, novel bioprocess design, and end product innovation.
Earlier this year, CellX announced its plan to build China\'s first
cultivated meat pilot production facility, hosting multiple
thousand-liter bioreactors.

\"We have successfully developed 10+ cell lines from various species,
adapted 5+ of them into suspension culturing, and the leading cell line
has now entered pilot stage.\" said Dr. Chen, Director of R&D at CellX.
\"Besides, we have also developed multiple serum free media and improved
the yield significantly, enabling us to drastically reduce the
production cost. We are currently working on scaling up to 2,000L.\"

It is reported that the pilot production facility is jointly built by
CellX and Tofflon, a listed biotech and food equipment company. Besides
hosting multiple thousand liter bioreactors, the facility will also
provide an interactive space for consumers to taste CellX's demo
products. This facility will be China\'s first \"transparent food
space\" for cultivated meat R&D, pilot production, and public tasting.

Mr. Ziliang Yang, cofounder and CEO of CellX, shared the company\'s
strategic plans for the future:

\"Meat is a commodity that needs to be consistently produced at a
competitive cost and large scale. Each year, China alone consumes 100+
million tons of meat, more than a quarter of global meat consumption.
For cultivated meat to have a meaningful impact on our global food
supply chain, production at low cost and at scale is key.

Unfortunately, no company in our space has fully cracked the puzzle of
production at low cost and scale, yet. This is where CellX and China can
add value. Thanks to China\'s booming biopharma industry and
fermentation sector, there is already a good ecosystem in place,
including media and equipment at competitive pricing, as well as a large
pool of talented bioprocess engineers. All of which enables companies to
produce cultivated meat at a significantly lower cost in China.\"

Despite the recent trend of decoupling between China and the west,
Ziliang still believes in the prospect of globalization in the field of
cellular agriculture.

\"At the end of the day, carbon and sustainability are global issues
that humanity faces together. It\'s one of the few areas where there is
common understanding.\"

Due to its significance in carbon reduction and food security,
cultivated meat has been increasingly put under the spotlight in China.
In early 2022, cultivated meat and \"future foods\" were included in
China\'s 14th 5-Year plan by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs, for the very first time. During his speech to the annual
session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, President Xi also said that China must adopt "a
'Greater Food' approach" to nutrition, to ensure a secure supply of all
staple food groups.

\"The facility is almost ready, and we are about to start the first
batch of 2,000L run.\" Ziliang says. \"We will be opening our doors for
public tasting soon, and we are excited to invite you to Shanghai for a
taste of the future.\"
