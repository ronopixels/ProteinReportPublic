*Registration open until November 1st for students to take part in the
hackathon, learn about the space, meet industry mentors, and help
reimagine the future of food  *

Students from MIT, UC Davis, Stanford, Harvard, UC Berkeley,
Northwestern University, and numerous other academic institutions have
launched [Cultivate Tomorrow](https://www.cultivate-tmrw.com/), a
cellular agriculture hackathon to connect academia and industry.

Together, in teams of four, undergraduate and graduate students with
different majors, skill sets, backgrounds, and knowledge of
cell-cultured food products will apply their unique perspectives to help
design creative solutions to critical issues faced by the cellular
agriculture industry: Strengthening supply chain and production
processes, disseminating clear scientific communications, and creating
effective marketing/advertising strategies.

Toward these goals, Cultivate Tomorrow is offering three different
tracks in which students can compete, each with a winning prize
of \$2000:

1.  Work with an industry mentor to create an advertising campaign for a
    specific product
2.  Create a scientific communication platform to demystify and educate
    the public
3.  Propose an underutilized resource that may benefit the production of
    cell cultivated food (experiment costs will be subsidized)

With industry mentors like Jessica Weaver (Head of Strategic
Partnerships at [Cultured
Decadence](https://www.cultureddecadence.com/team)), Ari Ratner (Senior
Director of Brand Marketing at [Perfect
Day](https://perfectdayfoods.com/)), and Aryé Elfenbein (Co-founder of
[Wildtype](https://www.wildtypefoods.com/)), participants will get
first-hand knowledge from experts and founders active in the field.

Conceptualized during a social networking event for students interested
the food and agriculture sector, the Cultivate Tomorrow hackathon is
made possible by Merck's Innovation Center, TurtleTree Labs, New
Harvest, GFI, and many other supporters across the industry and beyond.

According to the organizers, three main goals have been defined for
the project:

1.  To foster collaboration and conversation between educational
    institutions and industry leaders that will generate innovative
    ideas and unique perspectives on the advancement of the field
2.  To lower the barrier for newcomers and help them recognize their
    unique value to help spread awareness of the initiative that aims to
    tackle many of the UN sustainability goals
3.  To host a fun, exciting, and educational event that creates a
    community across states, schools, companies, and people across the
    US all working towards the same goal of saving our planet
