Auckland, NZ, November 21, 2022 --- Opo Bio, New Zealand's first
cultivated meat company, emerges from stealth mode to announce a \$1.5M
Seed Round and launch their first research product. Opo Bio is a B2B
cultivated meat company, developing cell lines for the cultivated meat
industry from high health status New Zealand livestock. Their first
product, primary bovine muscle cells (Opo-Moo) is available for
researchers around the world to purchase. Opo's goal is to be the world
leading producer of cell lines for cultivated meat production at scale.

Cultivated meat starts with cells and commercial production requires
high-quality, high performing cell lines. As a result, many companies
are keeping their cell lines tightly sealed, creating barriers to
progress within the industry. Opo's cell lines will be available for
companies to licence. They are initially focussing on cell lines that
form cow and pig muscle, fat and connective tissue.

Opo's first product is aimed at researchers working in the field of
cultivated meat. Currently, there are very few cultivated meat relevant
cell types available for purchase. Many researchers are using mouse
cells or having to isolate the cells within their laboratory, which is a
resource intensive process. Opo's primary cow cells are available for
researchers to purchase, and hopes these products will accelerate
research progress and transparency within the field.

The Company was founded in July 2022, by Dr Olivia Ogilvie, Dr Laura
Domigan and Dr Vaughan Feisst based on research developed in Dr Laura
Domigan's lab at University of Auckland. Opo's Seed round was led by
Matū Fund, followed by Booster, The Inventors\' Fund, Booster Innovation
Fund and Angels.
