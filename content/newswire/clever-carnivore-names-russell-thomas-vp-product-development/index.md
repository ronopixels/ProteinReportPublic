CHICAGO --- May 16, 2023 --- Clever Carnivore, a Chicago-based biotech
startup working to bring cultivated meat --- pork, beef and chicken ---
to consumers, today announced Russell Thomas, MSc, has joined the team
as vice president of product development. A triple-decade food scientist
with expertise in food safety, product development and operations
management, Thomas will accelerate the development of Clever Carnivore's
debut consumer product, the Clever Bratwurst.  

"Russell's experience as director of research and development at Tyson
is a huge asset to Clever Carnivore as we aim to unveil our prototype
product later this year," said Clever Carnivore CEO Virginia Rangos,
Ph.D.  

Thomas' resume includes a bachelor's in animal science and business and
a master's in poultry science and product technology from the University
of Arkansas. Most recently, Thomas served as vice president of product
development with a Silicon Valley cultivated fat company founded in late
2010.  

Prior to that, during Thomas' more than 33 years at Tyson Foods, one of
the largest food companies in the U.S., he served as manager, then
director of research and development.  

Thomas' hiring represents a milestone for Clever Carnivore. The addition
of an experienced executive with demonstrated success bringing
innovative products to the global market propels Clever Carnivore into
the exciting prototype development stage. Leveraging his decades of
accomplishments in the food sciences, Thomas will spearhead the creation
of a delicious, accessible product line --- starting with sausages.  

"I'm excited about joining Clever Carnivore," said Thomas. "I entered
the food industry more than three decades ago because I believe there's
no greater way to serve humanity than by working to provide accessible,
sustainable food to people. The technology being developed by Clever
Carnivore aligns with that mission."  

Clever Carnivore has been focused on scaling meat production and
bringing costs down --- producing high-quality pork at consumer-ready
prices. With Thomas on the team, the company is ready to start turning
pork into bratwurst. Clever Carnivore's cost and scale advantages put
Thomas on track to cook up something delicious.  

Clever Carnivore's headquarters and lab are located in Chicago's Lincoln
Park neighborhood. Thomas' appointment is effective immediately.
