Pune, India 10 May 2022 - Proeon, an India based start-up that produces
next generation plant-based proteins that are superior in functional,
nutritional and sensory profiles, was selected among hundreds of
candidates as one of the World Economic Forum's "Technology Pioneers".
Proeon is an R&D driven ingredient innovation company, founded by Ashish
Korde and Kevin Parekh in 2018, which develops plant-based ingredients
to make food sustainable for people and the planet by making plant-based
proteins that are comparable to animal sources in nutritional value and
better for the population and planet.

The World Economic Forum's Technology Pioneers are early to growth-stage
companies from around the world that are involved in the use of new
technologies and innovation that are poised to have a significant impact
on business and society.

With their selection as Technology Pioneer, Co-founder Ashish Korde from
Proeon will be invited to participate at World Economic Forum
activities, events and discussions throughout the year. Proeon will also
contribute to Forum initiatives over the next two years, working with
global leaders to help address key industry and societal issues.

"We're excited to welcome Proeon to our 2022 cohort of Technology
Pioneers," says Saemoon Yoon, Community Lead, Technology Pioneers, World
Economic Forum. "Proeon and its fellow pioneers are at the forefront of
industries that are critical to solving some of our world's most complex
issues today. We look forward to their contribution to the World
Economic Forum in its commitment to improving the state of the world."

A total of 4 companies from across the globe doing pathbreaking work
towards creating sustainable food systems are a part of 2022 cohort of
Technology Pioneers, Proeon being the only India-based start-up in this
track. "It's great to be acknowledged as pioneer by the World Economic
Forum. It confirms our efforts towards ingredient innovation and being
at the forefront of disruption in plant-protein technology", says Kevin
Parekh, Co-founder at Proeon.

"Our vision is to make food that is sustainable and better for
consumption for the population and the planet. India's unique crop
biodiversity has offered us the potential to leverage native sources
like Mung bean, Indian Bengal gram and sustainable, climate resilient
crops like Amaranth for their excellent nutritional values and
functional possibilities to work as key ingredients for replacing animal
origin proteins. Working with these sources, we aim to positively impact
the lives of small-scale farmers by increasing incomes and reducing
their market risks, and have a significant environmental impact in the
face of growing climate concerns. We look forward to the forum dialogues
on this challenge", adds Ashish Korde, co-founder at Proeon.

This year's cohort has 31% representation from Asia, out of which 5 are
based out of India.

Varun Deshpande, Managing Director of expert alternative proteins
non-profit The Good Food Institute India, added "As we continue to
contend with the threats of climate change, food insecurity, and public
health crises, we can no longer afford incremental thinking.
Transformative, paradigm-shifting technologies like alternative proteins
are our best bet at building back better, and innovators like Proeon are
showing that the next wave of smart protein pioneers are emerging from
across the developing world. Ecosystems like India's, with our unique
opportunities and challenges, provide fertile ground for a more secure,
sustainable, and nourishing food system through visionary business
stewardship. We are delighted to work alongside partners like Proeon and
the World Economic Forum community to build that future."

For the first time, over one-third of selected Technology Pioneer firms
are led by women, well above the industry average. The firms also come
from regions all around the world, creating a truly global community.
The diversity of these companies extends to their innovations as well.
This year's Tech Pioneer firms are shaping the future by advancing
technologies such as AI, IoT, robotics, blockchain, biotechnology and
many more.

Technology Pioneers have been selected based on the community's
selection criteria, which includes innovation, impact and leadership as
well as the company's relevance with the World Economic Forum's
Platforms.
