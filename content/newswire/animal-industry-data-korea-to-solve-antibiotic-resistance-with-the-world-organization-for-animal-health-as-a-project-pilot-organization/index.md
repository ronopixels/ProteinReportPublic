**Seoul, November 13, 2023** â€” Animal Industry Data Korea (AIDKOREA) announced its participation as a validating institution in the 'Economic Impact Study of Antibiotic Resistance' project conducted by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), aiming to represent data on antibiotic resistance issues that affect both livestock and humans in livestock farms.

WOAH, an international organization established to improve global livestock health and welfare, is responsible for establishing standards for livestock disease control, diagnosis and quarantine, and the project will evaluate the economic impact of antibiotic resistance on humans and livestock from the perspective of "One Health," the concept that humans, animals and the environment are connected as one.

The results of the study will be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly in October next year and will be utilized to develop international responses and policies to antibiotic resistance.

AIDKOREA will play a role in the project by demonstrating the impact of livestock management methodologies on antibiotic resistance and farm economics. As the only company in Korea to participate in the project, it was recognized for having the solutions, experimental farms, and data necessary to derive the impact of livestock management methodologies on farmers' antibiotic resistance and economic performance by operating the livestock digital healthcare 'Farmsplan'. It was also recognized as the only company in the world with the capacity to generate empirical data from livestock farmers, which is key to the project.

In addition to AIDKOREA, the project involves leading global organizations such as the Global Research on Antibiotic Resistance (GRAM Project), the Institute for Metrology and Health Evaluation (IMHE), the World Bank (WB), and the RAND Corporation to study the economic impact of antibiotic resistance and build economic models.

Farmsplan is a livestock health management solution based on AI, bio, and veterinary technologies. It reduces the use of antibiotics and prevents diseases by monitoring livestock health 24 hours a day using CCTV and synthesizing AI-analyzed data and veterinarian's regular check-ups to manage livestock health.

Antibiotic resistance is the ability of microorganisms to survive exposure to antibiotics. It is a threat to human and livestock health because antibiotic-resistant bacteria make antibiotics less effective in treating disease.

Overdosing livestock with antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance in their bodies, making antibiotics ineffective when used to treat disease. Humans can also develop antibiotic resistance by consuming livestock products that have been distributed with antibiotics in them, making it difficult to treat diseases.

In 2019, 4.95 million people died from antibiotic resistance, according to a report released by GRAM in 2022, and a 2017 report by the World Bank estimated that antibiotic resistance will cost the world $3.4 trillion in annual gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated antibiotic resistance as one of the top 10 global public health threats.

AIDKOREA will conduct a seven-month study from this month to May next year, focusing on pig farmers who have applied FarmsPlan and those who have not applied the solution. The economic impact of AI-based farm management will be evaluated by comparing data on pig biomarkers and disease tests, farm operating costs, and the types and dosages of medications, including antibiotics, prescribed by veterinarians. 

In the future, AIDKOREA plans to expand the supply of Farmsplan to farmers at home and abroad based on the economic improvement effects of farmers who manage livestock health with Farmsplan derived through this project.  

"In line with our mission, we are encouraged to participate in the WOAH project as the data generated from our managed farms has been recognized globally for its reliability," said Daniel Kyeong, CEO of AIDKOREA. "Through our participation in this project, we will contribute to the recognition of our FarmsPlan technology, which combines AI and bio, overseas and lead the development of one-health-based animal husbandry in Korea."

**About AID (Animal Industry Data)**

AID is a livestock tech startup that was founded in 2017 with operations in Korea, India, and Malaysia. The company operates Farmsplan, a digital healthcare solution for livestock that is based on data, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and veterinary medicine. Farmsplan uses CCTV installed in barns to monitor livestock conditions and analyzes the data using AI to quickly identify abnormalities. Additionally, customized management by veterinarians is employed to identify the health status of livestock and prevent diseases. The healthy livestock products are sold at the premium livestock market called 'Gullyjumper'. AIDKOREA has attracted a total of KRW 32 billion in investment so far and was awarded the Presidential Citation for the Science and Technology Awards by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs in recognition of its achievements in commercializing Korea's first livestock digital healthcare technology.
