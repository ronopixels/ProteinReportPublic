The New, one of Latin America's fastest-growing plant-based meat brands,
announced today it has secured funding from Lever VC, a leading global
investor in the alternative protein space, and Paulo Veras, Founder and
CEO of 99, Brazil's first tech unicorn. Funding will be used to complete
expansion of a 1,000 square meter production facility amid heavy demand
for the company's products at national and regional retailers.

Launched in September 2019 by plant-based triathlete and successful
entrepreneur Bruno Fonseca, The New produces plant-based salmon, cod,
chicken, and beef products. All products are non-GMO and free of all
common allergens including soy and gluten, positioning The New alongside
Beyond Meat as one of the only high-quality plant-based meat brands free
of these two common allergens. The company has already grown to over 700
points of sale in its first 18 months of operation, including placement
at Brazil's two largest retail chains Pao de Acucar and CarreFour.

"Since 2017 we have been researching and developing our products with
the goal of offering something more delicious and cleaner than
everything else in the Brazilian market today," said Bruno Fonseca, CEO
and founder of The New. "For example, we do not use hydrogenated palm
fat, choosing instead to use natural coconut fat, which when combined
with pea protein has an incredible flavor."

That flavor has caught the attention of consumers seeking a healthier
and more sustainable diet, as well as leading supermarket chains.
Brazilian retail leader Pão de Açucar, one of The New's key accounts,
reported that plant-based burgers accounted for 30% of all hamburger
sales at its stores last year.

\"We are incredibly excited to be partnered with The New,\" said Nick
Cooney, Managing Partner at global alternative protein fund Lever VC,
whose partners were early backers of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.
\"When we carried out consumer taste panels of plant-based meat brands
in Brazil, over 90% liked The New\'s products best, and by a very wide
margin. We love their products, their team, their commitment to R&D and
continuous improvement, and their fast sales growth. Plant-based meat is
beginning to boom in Latin America, and we think The New will be a clear
category leader.\"

For angel investor Paulo Veras, who founded and ran Brazil's first tech
unicorn, ridehailing app 99, The New is where food meets tech. "The New
is spearheading the food revolution. Through its healthy and tasty
plant-based meat alternatives, it addresses some of humanity\'s biggest
challenges such as food, health and climate change\", said Veras.

The New's product line consists of The New Chicken 2.0™, a pea
protein-based product that is the first plant-based chicken fillet in
the Brazilian market; The New Burger™, a classic beef-style burger made
with pea protein that in consumer taste tests has consistently outranked
all competitors in Brazil; The New Fish™, the first salmon derived from
peas along with natural paprika extract, and rich in omega 3; as well as
newcomers cod fillet and cod dumplings, based on a pea protein and
jackfruit mix that mimics the fibers of fish meat.
