*Registration is open until November 10th for students to take part in
the hackathon, get mentored by industry leaders, and apply their

Boston, MA, October 18 --- After last year's inaugural Cultivate
Tomorrow Hackathon event, which invited students from academic
institutions across the US to design creative solutions for the cellular
agriculture industry, the competition is now open to students from
around the globe. With partners at Cell Ag Australia, Cell Ag
Netherlands, Cell Ag France, Wageningen Alt Protein, and many other
supporting organizations, the Cultivate team hopes to open the door to
cellular agriculture for more students.

The Cultivate Tomorrow Hackathon places undergraduate and graduate
students in multidisciplinary teams to design creative solutions to some
of the most critical hurdles faced by the industry. Each team will work
together with an industry mentor to focus on one of the competition\'s
two tracks:

1.  Advertising. The Advertising Track tasks teams with taking the
    perspective of a company selling a sustainable future food product.
    Teams will be expected to prepare a low-fidelity version of an
    advertising campaign that improves the perception of cultivated or
    precision fermentation-based products, presents the scientific
    concepts behind them, and excites the general public about the
    prospect of these new options.
2.  Underutilized Resource & Novel Technology. Teams in the
    Underutilized Resource Track will be tasked with identifying and
    evaluating a novel technology or resource that can drastically
    improve the state of R&D for animal cell culture or precision
    fermentation processes. They will produce a proposal of an
    underutilized resource that can help with cost reduction, quality
    improvement, environmental footprint, increase in process
    efficiency, or diversification of cultivated food products. Teams
    will choose a resource of interest and develop a research proposal
    that outlines the different experimental steps they would need to
    take to evaluate and validate this resource.

As part of the competition, exclusive seminars and talks from industry
and technical experts will be provided to give participants a rounded
view and additional insight into the possibilities and challenges of the
cellular agriculture sector. Teams are expected to conduct appropriate
research and compose reports detailing their efforts and findings that
will be presented to peers and judges.

\"This program fosters creativity, problem-solving, and out-of-the-box
thinking that will aid in societal understanding, development, and
integration of cell-based products,\" says Jasmin Kern, founder and
director of the Hackathon.

Made possible by Milipore Sigma's Innovation Center, Aleph Farms, and
New Harvest, among other supporters, this year\'s Cultivate Tomorrow
Hackathon will not only a award the winning teams of each track with a
\$2000 cash prize, but also the teams with the most disruptive tech
solution and most creative and original advertising campaign.
