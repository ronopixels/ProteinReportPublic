*Signs agreement to design the first-of-its-kind commercial
manufacturing plant solution in the region, with government support
under NextGen FDI initiative.*

(PALO ALTO, CA -- 10.20.22) \-- Change Foods has signed an agreement
with KEZAD Group to design a dedicated commercial manufacturing plant
for production of its animal-free dairy in Abu Dhabi, with the support
of the Ministry of Economy of the UAE under the NextGen FDI initiative.
The company also shared it is in the final stages of closing a bridge
funding round.

The planned facility will be the first of its kind in the region to
produce animal-free milk protein, casein, the main ingredient in
cheesemaking. Change Foods' casein is bioidentical to the traditional
dairy version but will be entirely animal-free \-- thus made with a
fraction of the environmental impact of animal-derived dairy. The
strategic location of the facility with multimodal connectivity would
also provide a shipping and distribution network to serve the rapidly
growing Middle East and Asia-Pacific region.

"We are honored to be a part of the UAE's NextGen FDI initiative and
grateful for the strategic partnership with KEZAD Group" said David
Bucca, Founder and CEO of Change Foods. "NextGen FDI is prioritizing
successful scaling of new sustainable food technologies like ours that
offer significant environmental and economic development benefits. The
strategic alignment behind our company's vision to help transition the
world to more sustainable food systems by scaling new food production
technology was clear from the start." 

Change Foods is pioneering precision fermentation technology that
integrates centuries-old fermentation techniques with the latest
bioengineering tools. The milk proteins produced via precision
fermentation are identical to those made by cows, so the resulting
cheese retains its authentic texture, taste, stretch and melting
characteristics of traditional dairy cheese.

Change Foods is focused primarily on the growing cheese industry, an
\$83 billion global food category and one of the world's most popular
foods. "Raising animals for food is an inefficient and
resource-intensive process that materially contributes to global
greenhouse gas emissions," said Bucca, "we think we can be an influence
of positive transformation for this dynamic and growing industry. This
will be a stellar example of how embracing new technologies can help us
overcome regional food security challenges."

With this announcement, the UAE continues its foray into the world food
innovation stage. The government will showcase its commitment in 2024
when Dubai hosts COP28, the United Nations' Climate Change Conference.
The UN is working to galvanize global action and establish policies and
investments to actively support decarbonization of energy and
agricultural sectors to limit the planet warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius
in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

"Change Foods is an outstanding example of the kind of emerging food
technology investments the United Arab Emirates wishes to make in
shaping a sustainable, secure and affordable food system that can serve
growing local and regional demand," said H.E. Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al
Zeyoudi, the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade.

"Initiatives such as NextGen FDI are helping to accelerate the
development of a knowledge-based economy, one in which advanced
technologies can be applied the challenges of sustainable manufacturing
and food security. We are excited to welcome Change Foods to the UAE and
further catalyze the nation's food-tech ecosystem, which will help
reduce our reliance on imports, enhance local production and inspire
further innovation," he added.

Bucca indicated his team is now in the midst of the facility design
stages.

**Change Foods** is creating animal-free dairy foods by leveraging
precision fermentation technology, starting with cheese. By harnessing
the power of microbes instead of animals to create real dairy proteins
and fats, the company is producing animal-free dairy foods that are
indistinguishable from their animal-based predecessors in taste and
texture, while delivering products that are more sustainable and better
for you. Change Foods is a US-Australian food tech company headquartered
