*Bio-FoodTech Innovator Becomes First Company to Develop Hybrid
Cell-Based Dairy Product Without Reliance on Animals*

REHOVOT, Israel -- November 16, 2022
-- [Wilk](https://wilkismilk.com/) (TASE: WILK), a developer of
authentic, cell-cultured human and animal milk and milk components, has
announced the successful development of the world's first yogurt
developed with cell-cultured milk fat. The hybrid product has been
validated by external laboratories confirming it meets the necessary
chemical and biological requirements and presented to select members of
the Israeli public for tasting.

The new yogurt is a first-of-its-kind hybrid product, incorporating milk
fat developed through cell-culturing technology to provide the full
nutritional benefits found in real milk fats. The result of Wilk\'s
intensive research and development efforts, the yogurt serves as a
concept product, providing validation of the company's technology and
potential future capabilities.

"This is a significant milestone, not just for Wilk, but for the Israeli
FoodTech space and wider global industry," said Tomer Aizen, CEO of
Wilk. "It signifies a major breakthrough in demonstrating our ability to
produce functional cell-cultured milk components that can be integrated
into a wide array of dairy products and brings us closer to realizing
our goal -- to produce authentic dairy products in a sustainable and
environmentally conscientious manner that will drive the industry
forward."

Milk fat has a significant influence on final dairy products, providing
the distinctive flavors and textures unique to foods such as yogurt. It
is precisely for this reason that the company chose yogurt as the first
hybrid product containing cell-cultured fat.

The new product will also support Wilk's efforts in developing human
milk fat components for integration into infant formula. The nutritional
benefits of cultured human milk fat play a central role in maintaining
an infant's digestive system, as well as the development of its brain
and nervous system. Wilk is directing the majority of its resources to
developing cell-cultured human milk fat for infant formula. This will be
used to replace vegetable fats currently present in formula, helping to
improve the development of premature and other at-risk infants.
