***The successful launch of a new skincare brand with the world\'s first
egg-derived cell culture supernatant\[1\]***

**Tokyo, Japan, June 1, 2022** --- IntegriCulture Inc. (hereafter
IntegriCulture), a Japanese cellular agriculture startup pioneering
revolutionary advancements in cellular agriculture and aims for a
sustainable world, today announced that CELLAMENT™\[2\], an egg-derived
skincare ingredient utilizing its proprietary cell culture technology,
has been adopted in new skincare brand l\'oeuf by essensebase launched
today by BASEPLUS Co., Ltd. This is the second skincare brands that
CELLAMENT™ has been selected and formulated as a main active ingredient
which even inspired the brand names\[3\] since its launch in April 2021.

Yuki Hanyu, CEO at IntegriCulture said: "Cellular agriculture is often
spoken in the food context, but what must not be forgotten is that
opportunities of cellular agriculture go beyond food. Examples include
solid materials like leather, fur and fluid substances like cosmetics
and pharmaceuticals. As a leading cellular agriculture company, we would
like to demonstrate such possibility with BASEPLUS's 'l\'oeuf advanced
serum' and 'l\'oeuf enrich cream.'"

**About CELLAMENT™**\
IntegriCulture has developed the CulNet™ system, which produces growth
factors and serum components that account for a large part of the cost
of producing cultured meat. The culture supernatant obtained from this
system includes various useful components necessary for culturing target
cells (e.g., muscle cells and liver cells).

Since it was confirmed that the culture supernatant of chicken egg
embryo extraembryonic membrane conditioned cells obtained at the
development stage of this CulNet™ system is also useful for human
skin\[4\], we have considered the stability as a cosmetic raw material.
It was launched our original cosmetic ingredient CELLAMENT™, which
designed to repair and rejuvenate the skin in April 2021. For more

**About IntegriCulture Inc.**\
We aim to use our proprietary low-cost cell culture technology CulNet™
system as a new platform in the biotechnology field, and to use it in
various fields such as foods and leather made up of animal cells. The
CulNet™ system is a versatile cell culture platform technology that
simulates the interaction between organs in animals (patented).
Theoretically, this technology can cultivate all animal cells on a large
scale and at low cost and is expected to be used for various purposes
including cultured meat. At the lab scale, we have already achieved the
production of serum components, which contributed to the high cost. By
realizing in-house production of serum components, it is not necessary
to use fetal bovine serum and growth factors, which are the main causes
of high cost of conventional cell culture, and the cost of cell culture
can be significantly reduced. For more information, visit
