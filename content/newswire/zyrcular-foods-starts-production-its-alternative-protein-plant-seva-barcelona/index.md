-   After an investment of €3.5 million, the factory will start to
    produce plant-based foods this Spring.
-   The plant has been constructed with sustainable materials and
    techniques and uses only green energy. Initial annual production
    capacity is one million kilos.

**Seva (Osona), 1st March 2020.-** [**Zyrcular
Foods**](https://zyrcularfoods.com/)**,** a company devoted to the
sustainable production and distribution of foods based on plant protein,
has started production at an alternative protein plant in the town of
Seva, in the Osona region of Barcelona province.

The company has invested a total of €3.5 million in the 1,500 square
metre facility. Operating initially with a single shift, Zyrcular Foods
will produce up to 1,000,000 kilograms annually of alternative protein
for third parties, supermarket chains, foodservice companies and food
manufacturers.

The plant is currently in commissioning and will start production in
mid-March. It will be the **first factory 100% dedicated to alternative
protein production** in Spain. Zyrcular Foods has also acquired adjacent
plots with a view to expanding production of plant protein and other
alternative protein foods in the medium and long term. 

**Launch pad for startups and international businesses**

As part of the Netherlands' Wageningen Food Valley food cluster and the
Good Food Institute (which started in the United States and is now
active worldwide), Zyrcular Foods will offer its facility in Seva to
startups and foodtech businesses from Spain and other countries to
produce and sell their products in Europe. Many businesses will be able
to reduce their carbon footprint by using the new facility to produce in
the Mediterranean region rather than importing their products.   

**A sustainable business for a greener world**

Sustainability is one of the foundations of the project, consistent with
the company's business goals. That is why the plant is 100% green: it
operates with renewable on-site solar energy and energy supplied by
PEUSA (a renewable energy supplier that operates in the Pyrenees).

The project's financing is also structured following the principles of
sustainable finance. The plant is certified under the internationally
recognised ISO 14001 environmental management standard and is
practically emissions neutral. The facility is at the entry to the
Biosphere Reserve of the Montseny Natural Park and its design respects
the natural environment.   

**"Our dream must be to produce using locally grown plant raw material:
that would enable us to bring our CO2 footprint down as low as
possible,"** said Santiago Aliaga, Zyrcular Foods' CEO, who went on to
add **"we will encourage growers to shift to new legume crops and help
to counteract rural depopulation through a value-added project."**

**A system open for use by other businesses**

The Zyrcular Foods group is made up of three businesses or business
units: Zyrcular Labs, Zyrcular Plant and Zyrcular Brands. Zyrcular Labs
is involved in innovation and food development; Zyrcular Plant -- the
new factory -- is devoted to manufacturing; and Zyrcular Brands works on
product distribution. With this open system, Zyrcular Foods offers its
services to businesses that need to develop new foods, that need to
manufacture at scale or that need a distribution arm to reach the retail
or foodservice markets in Spain.   

Aliaga affirms that **"we have gone from being a distributor of big
international plant protein brands like Beyond Meat, NEXT, Gardein and
Sophie's Kitchen to producing them under contract. This is a significant
milestone for innovation in the food industry in Spain."**

The company currently distributes leading international alternative
protein brands like Beyond Meat, NEXT!, Gardein, Sophie's Kitchen and
Green Vie. The business is a supplier for big supermarket chains like
ALDI, La Sirena, Sánchez-Romero, and foodservice companies like Áreas,
Pad Thai Wok and Fosters Hollywood.

**About Zyrcular Foods**

Zyrcular Foods is a Spanish manufacturing, distribution and research
company working with food products made with plant proteins. Zyrcular
Foods' production and distribution are founded on sustainability,
innovation and research.
