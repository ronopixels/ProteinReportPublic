*108Labs is building Earth's first autonomous Cellufacturing® facility
to enable continuously scalable, cost-effective, automated food-scale
production of cell-cultured human milk*

**Hillsborough, NC** --- Eighteen months after creating the world's
first cell cultured human milk, 108Labs is now focused on accelerating
the field from lab to factory by building and programming the world's
first autonomous Cellufacturing® facility and artificial intelligence
platform for production of cell cultured human milk in the birthplace of
biosynthetic human milk, Hillsborough, North Carolina.

With an autonomous factory design that turns raw medium ingredients and
validated cell lines into sterile packaged cell cultured human milk
products like Colostrupedics™ whole-human infant formula, the 108Labs'
autonomous factory design will create and merge state-of-the-art methods
in artificial intelligence, cellular agriculture, automated factory
systems, modular biomanufacturing, automated bioprocessing, and sterile
packaging, all driven by 108Labs' smart Cellufacturing®
software platform.

108Labs' first milk Cellufacturing® plant will autonomously grow
artificial mammary glands, continuously prepare medium and growth
factors, maintain and harvest milk bioreactors, and bioprocess and
package human milk products within a closed system for pathogen-free
production and sterile delivery from bioreactor to mouth.

"We are engineering the world's largest mammary cell farm inside the
smartest cellular agriculture factory, utilizing innovative engineering
and artificial intelligence with continuous monitoring to autonomously
produce cell cultured human milk derived nutraceuticals and therapeutics
at commodity cost and food scale," said Shayne Giuliano, CEO of 108Labs.

With front-to-end Cellufacturing® automation, the 108Labs autonomous
milk factory will reduce production costs beyond 99% per ounce compared
to lab grown milk to accelerate the field from lab to factory by
achieving cost parity and production scale comparable to
animal-derived milk.

Upon completion of 108Labs first pilot milk factory, 108Labs plans to
scale with global open innovation partners to build autonomous milk
Cellufacturing® facilities around the world to feed newborns
Colostrupedics™ whole-human infant formula and replace animal-derived
milk products. 108Labs also plans to build an autonomous human milk
Cellufacturing® facility on Mars.

**About 108Labs**

[108Labs](http://108labs.net) is a biotechnology and software company
founded in Research Triangle Park in 2013 with a mission to invent
disruptive cellular agriculture projects, and 108Labs has successfully
pioneered the development of cell cultured human milk and human milk
antibodies. 108Labs is now building the world's first autonomous cell
cultured milk and milk antibody factory in Hillsborough, North Carolina
to produce Colostrupedics™ whole-human infant formula with
state-of-the-art biotechnology and artificial intelligence to fulfill
108Labs' dream to feed, build, and heal the world with
Cellufacturing® innovations.
