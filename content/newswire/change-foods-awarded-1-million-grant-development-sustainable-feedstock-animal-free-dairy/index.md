**Australian Government grant unlocks greater public-private
collaboration**

(PALO ALTO, CA - May 5, 2022) -- The Australian Commonwealth Government
has announced a \$1 million (AUD) grant to Change Foods to upcycle
Queensland sugarcane fiber
([bagasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagasse)). The project is
intended to transform the low-cost waste fiber into highly valuable
feedstock needed to produce sustainable animal-free dairy products made
via precision fermentation.

[Change Foods](http://changefoods.com/) is a US-Australian food tech
company founded in Australia by David Bucca and Prof. Junior Te'o, and
headquartered in Palo Alto, California, with research laboratories and
teams on both continents.

The research will be a collaboration between Change Foods and Queensland
University of Technology (QUT). The project will support the manufacture
of animal-free dairy, employing microbes in place of cows to produce
real milk proteins, and further reduce the environmental waste from
sugarcane. "This is a dynamic opportunity for public-private partnership
with the Federal government and QUT. As part of our broader
sustainability mission, we intend to upcycle local waste product into a
high-value input that enables production of our animal-free dairy," said
David Bucca, Founder and CEO of Change Foods.

The Queensland agricultural region produces 30 million tons of sugarcane
annually, resulting in 10 million tons of residual cane fiber. Simple
carbohydrates, such as sugar, are a vital feedstock for microbes used in
creating a milk protein - casein - a key component in cheese-making. "We
want to prioritize and strengthen our valuable partnerships between
Australian businesses, our world-class research institutions and
regional communities, ensuring regional Australia is at the forefront of
innovation and change," said Ms. Angie Bell, MP and Federal Member for
Moncrieff, in a statement.

The competitive Commonwealth Government grant was awarded to Change
Foods as part of the Securing Raw Materials Program, which helps
businesses to expand operations in regional Australia and develop
stronger ties with regional Universities. "We were successful in winning
the grant because of our strong partnership with QUT and the recognition
that Queensland - with a wealth of world-leading micro-biologists and
access to sugarcane waste - is uniquely positioned to benefit from the
shift to synthetic biology and future food manufacturing" said Tom
Davies, Vice President of Research and Operations (APAC) for Change
Foods, "we are developing more sustainable food solutions that are not
dependent on animal agriculture -- a major source of greenhouse
emissions, and further reducing our impact by upcycling of waste to
promote the circular economy."

Change Foods is on a mission to transform the global dairy industry by
creating real dairy ingredients by using microbes, instead of cows.

The company intends to enter the \$89 billion global cheese category
with products estimated to require 100x less land, 10x less water and 5x
less energy than conventional dairy. Change is targeting initial market
launch of their first products in late 2024.

**About Change Foods**

Change Foods is creating animal-free dairy foods by leveraging precision
fermentation technology, starting with cheese. By harnessing the power
of microbes instead of animals to create real dairy proteins and fats,
the company is producing animal-free dairy foods that are
indistinguishable from their animal-based predecessors in taste and
texture, while delivering products that are more sustainable and better
for you. Change Foods is a US-Australian food tech company founded in
May 2020 and headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.
