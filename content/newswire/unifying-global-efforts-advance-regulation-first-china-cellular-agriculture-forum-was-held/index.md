The first China Cellular Agriculture Forum discussion panel was held on
April 19, Beijing time. The panel was a collaborative success, with
attendees from around 30 organizations\*, representing leading
cultivated meat companies, ecosystem builders, research institutions,
and upstream and downstream partners from both within and outside of
China.

This Forum was organized with the vision of advocating science-based
regulatory policies, facilitating public acceptance of technologies and
products related to cellular agriculture, and reaching a consensus on
industry-best-practice specifically in the China space. The Forum hopes
to unite stakeholders (academia, regulatory authorities, industry
groups, etc.) across the field of cellular agriculture to establish a
China-focused industry platform, laying the groundwork for future joint
efforts in promoting public acceptance in the Chinese market space.

International Food Law expert, Mr. Wilfred Feng, presented a top-level
overview of the current regulatory framework in China, stating that
\"there are four key regulatory issues to work on, including
nomenclature and categorization of products, the data requirement and
protocols for pre-market clearance, the consensus of
industry-best-practice, and the licensing of food production in China\".
Mr. Feng also shared that with cultivated meat being listed in the 14th
Five-Year Plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development,
"the Chinese government has already posted a positive attitude towards
this new technology, and now is the right time to start communicating
with the Chinese government for further development\", says Mr. Feng.

Representatives from China Meat Research Center (CMRC) and China Meat
Association (CMA) also participated in the panel to share their views on
cultivated meat and its technological development. CMRC commented that
cultivated meat production is a revolutionary technology that combines
innovative techniques from different fields, but they also noted that
there is a lot of work to be done to build up a respective framework;
CMA expressed its support for building an industry platform, saying that
a focused channel might be helpful in starting a conversation with the
officials.

Notably, China-based cultivated meat startups recognized the urgent need
for the industry to come together and work as a group to promote and
grow. They reached a consensus that a cohesive platform is critical to
coordinate efforts and to create synergies that benefit all. \"I believe
the forum today is a great starting point for more collaborations
between companies within China and with international players interested
in entering China", says Mr. Ziliang Yang, the CEO and co-founder of
CellX, a cellular agriculture startup based in Shanghai. Meanwhile, Dr.
Shijie Ding, the CEO of a Nanjing-based cultivated meat company, Joes
Future Food, discussed about the local challenges that companies are
facing in China, such as those in stem cell research and bioreactor
equipment designs. Dr. Ding emphasized with a positive note that \"the
Chinese government has shown great support to green technologies,
especially in cultivated meat". From the cultivated seafood sector,
Avant Meats remarked on the uniqueness of each regulatory system,
suggesting that "startups can contribute data to Chinese regulators to
formulate a framework for food safety assessments to help speed up the
legislation process", says Carrie Chan, CEO and co-founder of Avant
Meats.

Aside from local organizations and companies, overseas parties such as
Aleph Farms, APAC Society for Cellular Agriculture, BlueNalu, Merck
KGaA, and Japan Association for Cellular Agriculture, also participated
in the discussion of advancing regulations and contributed to future
project ideations. Under collective efforts, the Forum is orienting
itself to help push the regulatory status forward in China and around
the world. In the future, cellular agriculture will become one of the
deciding means to greatly reduce the use of energy, freshwater, and
arable land for food production. With such a large consumer base and an
ever-rising protein demand, cellular agriculture has a strong stance in
China, and the China market is certainly attractive to a lot of players
outside of the region.

\*China-based organizations are represented by research institutions
such as East China University of Science and Technology, Jiangnan
University, and Zhejiang University; local cultivated meat companies
such as Avant Meats, CellX and Joes Future Food; industry partners such
as AgFood Future, APAC Society for Cellular Agriculture, Japan
Association for Cellular Agriculture, the China Meat Research Center,
China Meat Association, GFIC, Lever VC, etc. Industry leaders from
across the globe with interests in the China market also attended the
Forum panel, which included upstream manufacturers such as Merck KGaA,
Esco Lifescience Group, downstream companies such as Aleph Farms,
BlueNalu, IntegriCulture Inc., Mission Barns, Mosa Meat, Shiok Meats,
SuperMeat, TurtleTree Labs, UPSIDE Foods, etc., and research
institutions such as Tufts University/National Institute for Cellular
Agriculture, etc.
