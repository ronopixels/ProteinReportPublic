**New York, May 12, 2023** --- To support other investors in making
informed bets, alternative protein investment firm Lever VC---whose
partners have invested in over 65 companies in the space over the past
nine years---has released its internal playbook for assessing the
scientific progress of cultivated meat companies. Developed through
conducting scientific diligence into scores of cultivated meat companies
over the years, the firm's *Cultivated Meat Scientific Benchmarks* white
paper covers the technical milestones and competencies Lever VC expects
cultivated meat startups to have achieved by each fundraising stage,
based on industry-standard progress rates. The benchmarks were developed
by Lever VC's scientific and technical team to assess the technical
credibility and potential of startups with limited proof of concept.

Venture-backed sectors across the technology spectrum have faced public
scandals in which celebrated startups were revealed to not have the
technological capabilities investors believed them to have, with such
"vaporware" incidents shaking confidence in their respective sectors.
Recent media stories have highlighted similar risks and fears of a
Theranos-style outcome in the cultivated meat sector. While thorough
investor diligence is critical for preventing such situations,
evaluating cultivated meat and dairy startups can prove challenging for
those with limited technical expertise in this complex and nascent
industry.

\"We use these benchmarks to more quantitatively evaluate cultivated
meat companies and identify areas where they lack progress or where
certain metrics may be overly optimistic and require additional
claim-vetting,\" said Jonathan Avesar, Lever VC\'s lead scientific
advisor.

\"We supplement our overall scientific analysis with these quantitative
benchmarks that allow us to compare progress between companies, which
aids in our evaluation of the risk/reward profile," said Jonathan
Avesar, Lever VC\'s lead scientific advisor. "The benchmarks also serve
toward understanding if certain metrics may be overly optimistic and
require additional claim vetting.\"

"Especially for very early-stage companies, where cell mass quantities
are extremely low and access to analytical tools is limited, rigorous
scientific diligence is essential to validate a viable investment
opportunity," added Lever VC scientific associate Jasmin Kern. "It is
especially important to scrutinize any assumptions made by start-ups and
to verify the sources they are based on since they play a key role in
the projections and models that inform decision-making."

Lever VC, which is currently raising a \$250 million Fund II, released
its internal benchmarks in the hopes that publicly sharing its own
standards would help investors that do not have internal scientific and
technical expertise on the cultivated meat category better validate the
claims and progress of startups in the sector.
