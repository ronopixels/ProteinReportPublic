Chinese President Xi Jinping highlights alternative protein as important
for food security and sustainability in a new speech to
government officials

**Beijing** - China should adopt a "greater food" approach and look at
plant-based, fermented and cell-cultured animal protein in addition to
traditional food sources as a way to protect the environment and achieve
sustainable development, announced Chinese President Xi JinPing in a
recent speech. The speech, delivered March 6, 2022 at the 13th National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), President Xi also stated that science and technology are key to
food security and that the government should be aware of the changing
trends in people's food choices. President Xi's remarks were reported
publicly after the event [by state-affiliated news agency
Xinhua](http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/2022-03/06/c_1128443977.htm).

"Apart from traditional crops, livestock, and poultry resources, we
should expand the use of biological resources," President Xi told
delegates. "By developing biological science, biotechnology, and
bio-industries, we can obtain calories and protein from plants, animals,
and microorganisms." The remarks follow the recent release of the China
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs' new Five-Year Plan, which
calls for "research and development in cultivated meat, plant-based egg,
milk, and oil, recombinant protein technology" and other high-technology
areas as important for food security and long-term economic development.
President Xi is one of only a handful of global leaders to have publicly
embraced alternative protein as an important strategic priority
for development.

"The government's call to diversify protein sources and develop the
alternative protein space, including by using biotechnology to produce
animal proteins through cell cultivation and fermentation, will provide
major tailwinds to the growth of this sector," said Lily Chen, Program
Director at Lever China, which works to promote entrepreneurship and
investment in the alternative protein sector in the country. "Lever
China is committed to helping company founders, investors and food
brands grow the alternative protein sector, and to helping China be a
global technology leader in plant-based proteins and in the cultivation
and fermentation of animal protein."

The number of alternative protein start-ups in China has increased
significantly in the past three years, with over RMB 1.563 billion (USD
\$245 million) invested in the sector during the period. A recent market
study by Lever China and leading Chinese food media outlet *Food Plus*
found that 90% of Chinese consumers would eat cultivated meat and 30%
would consider making cultivated meat their main source of protein in
the future if pricing and taste were able to match the
conventional version.
