**Vancouver, B.C.  -- March 15, 2021** -- [Eat Beyond Global
Holdings](https://eatbeyondglobal.com/) ([CSE:
EATS](https://thecse.com/en/listings/diversified-industries/eat-beyond-global-holdings-inc)) ([OTCPK:
EATBF](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/EATBF/overview)) ([FSE:
988](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/equity/eat-beyond-global-hldgs)) 
("Eat Beyond" or the "Company"), an investment issuer focused on the
global plant-based and alternative food sector, is announcing that its
portfolio company Nabati Foods Global Inc., formerly Nabati Foods Inc.
("**Nabati**"), has closed an oversubscribed \$7.7 million private
placement, and has restructured with plans to go public.

Nabati previously announced its intentions to raise \$4 million, but due
to tremendous demand, has increased this to \$7.7 million. The net
proceeds will be used to fund the Nabati's proposed go-public
transaction as well as for business development, working capital, plant
expansion, and to purchase equipment to expand production capacity and
develop new product lines.

Founded in Edmonton, Nabati is a fast-growing food tech company offering
whole, natural, plant-based foods for health-conscious consumers. 

"Once the financing was announced for Nabati, the company received
thousands of inquiries from interested parties looking to invest," Eat
Beyond CEO Patrick Morris said. "This new capital can help to catapult
Nabati to the next level by enabling the company to expand its
production capacity to meet the ever-growing demand for its products.
Eat Beyond looks forward to working closely with Nabati to support their
innovation, growth, and expansion."

Nabati currently offers three plant-based product lines including
dairy-free cheesecakes, cheese alternatives, and plant-based meats, with
plans to add more innovative product lines. Nabati products are sold
across North America via grocery, online, foodservice and retail
channels. 

"Nabati has seen unprecedented growth over the past year, despite the
uncertainty consumers are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic," said
Ahmad Yehya, CEO of Nabati. "We designed our products and mix of
distribution channels to be able to weather economic challenges, and we
are now seeing the fruits of that labour."
