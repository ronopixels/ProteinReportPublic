**Durham, North Carolina -- March 9th, 2023** -- Biotechnology startup
Tiamat Sciences today announced its \$2 million seed-extension financing
round led by 8090 Industries with participation from new and existing
investors. Using the power of plants, Tiamat provides animal-free
recombinant growth factors with a highly flexible technology, at a
fraction of their cost and with a reduced carbon footprint. The new
funds will accelerate product validation in the cellular agriculture and
regenerative medicine markets and establish strategic partnerships with
industry leaders.

Along with 8090 Industries, who led this seed-extension round, True
ventures, Social impact capital, Cantos, Portfolia, Alexandria, Siddhi
Capital, Sara Murray, Seed folio, Sustainable Food Ventures and
Exponential Impact also participated in this financing round. This
brings the total fund raised by Tiamat Sciences to \$5.4M.

This financing round comes as the startup gears up for rapid growth,
with recent expansion into new markets and partnerships.

"At 8090 Industries, we help build breakthroughs into category defining
industrial juggernauts focused on decarbonizing every sector, which is
why we're incredibly excited to back France and her team at Tiamat -- as
they pioneer industrial-scale production of growth factors with their
proprietary animal-free recombinant proteins that are 10x cheaper than
the market today with plans to drive down costs by 1,000x in a few
years. With several engagements with leading protein companies already
underway while its technology shows further promise for regenerative
medicine and pharma, Tiamat is off to a fast start and industry leaders
have taken serious notice." said Rayyan Islam, Co-Founder and General
Partner of 8090 Industries.

This comes on the heels of Tiamat Sciences' recent successes, which
include new products in the portfolio, a new patent, and an increase of
1000x of the yield in only 6 months.

As Tiamat Sciences is moving toward new products and markets with this
round of funding, the company Tiamat Sciences is preparing for
production in March 2023 to commercialize its products to empower the
biotechnology revolution of Cellular Agriculture and Regenerative
Medicine.

Tiamat is preparing for their next round of funding in 2023 to achieve
the site expansion in North CarolinaÂ  and Belgium ahead of schedule,
continuing to supply the growing demand of growth factors. "Tiamat's
most versatile platform gives the flexibility the nascent markets need
to validate and succeed in each stage of development." said
France-Emmanuelle Adil, Founder and CEO of Tiamat Sciences.

Key partner in this journey is Ryan Bethencourt, CEO of Wild Earth, as
an advisor and collaborator. These partnerships give Tiamat Sciences
access to market expertise as they work to bring their products to
market.
