**Amsterdam, The Netherlands --- May 10, 2023.** Farmless, a Dutch
startup, is using fermentation to produce carbon-negative, functional
proteins with a complete amino acid profile. This technology, which will
decouple food production from agricultural land, is backed by a €1.2
million pre-seed round led by Revent, Nucleus Capital, and Possible
Ventures.

-   Fermentation platform is based on liquid feedstock made with CO2,
    hydrogen and renewable energy
-   Initial product is a functional protein that provides all essential
    amino acids and 
-   Requires 500x less land than animal protein

Instead of using sugar, Farmless is pushing the fermentation frontier
using a liquid feedstock which can be made with renewable energy. This
makes Farmless' process dramatically more resource- and land efficient
than animal farming, requiring 10-25x less land than plant protein and
250-500x less than animal protein.

The €1.2 million pre-seed round was co-led by Revent, Nucleus Capital,
Possible Ventures with participation from HackCapital, Sustainable Food
Ventures, VOYAGERS Climate-Tech Fund, TET Ventures and angels Jenny Saft
through the Atomico Angel program, Ron Shigeta, Martin Weber, Rick
Bernstein, Nadine Geiser, Joy Faucher, Michele Tarawneh, Alexander
Hoffmann and Christian Stiebner.

*\"We\'re excited by the Farmless approach to fermentation. We\'re
specifically interested in food technologies with high scalability and
the potential to rapidly outperform on the cost per kg of protein.
Across both of these dimensions Farmless shows great potential and it\'s
a delight to work with this remarkable team,\"* says Lauren Lentz from
Revent.

*\"We're proud to be backed by an amazing group of experienced climate
tech investors who share our mission. With our fermentation platform we
aim to dramatically outperform animal agriculture and reliably produce
low-cost proteins at a planetary scale. We believe this technology has
the potential to end factory farming, rewild our planet and draw down
gigatons of carbon,\"* explains Adnan Oner, the founder and CEO of
Farmless.

**A new food repertoire**

Farmless\' initial products are designed to replace animal proteins, as
the majority of agricultural land is currently used to feed animals. The
Farmless fermentation platform can potentially create a whole new food
repertoire, producing proteins, carbohydrates, beneficial fats,
vitamins, and minerals from the bottom up.

**About Farmless & The age of electric agriculture**

Farmless' mission is to free food production from animals and
agricultural land. The company's goal is to build a fermentation
platform which can turn renewable electricity into food. Farmless was
founded by [Adnan Oner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnanoner/), a
physicist and serial entrepreneur with a mission to create a future
worth getting excited about. \
