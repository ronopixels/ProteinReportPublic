**AMSTERDAM, March 23, 2021** -- [Meatable](https://www.meatable.com/),
the cultivated meat startup, has closed \$47 million USD in its Series A
funding round, bringing the company's total funding to \$60 million.
Meatable finalized its first showcase product in 2020 and aims to use
the new funds to advance small-scale production at the Biotech Campus
Delft and to diversify its product portfolio.

The consortium consists of Dr. Rick Klausner, [Section
32](https://section32.com/), [Dr. Jeffrey
Leiden](https://www.vrtx.com/about-us/leadership/jeffrey-leiden-md-phd/),
and [DSM
Venturing](https://www.dsm.com/corporate/about/businesses/dsm-venturing.html),
and includes existing investors, such as [BlueYard
Capital](https://blueyard.com/), [Agronomics](https://agronomics.im/),
[Humboldt](https://humboldtfund.com/), and [Taavet
Hinrikus](https://www.weforum.org/people/taavet-hinrikus), showing
continued support. They recognize the positive impact cultivated meat
will have on climate change, see the trillion-dollar potential of the
cultivated meat marketplace, and are betting on Meatable to solve the
industry's scalability and speed-to-market challenges with its patented
opti-ox™ technology.

[Dr. Rick Klausner](https://lyell.com/our_team/rick-klausner/), former
director of the US National Cancer Institute and former Executive
Director of Global Health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, sees
great potential in Meatable and its technology.

"We are committed to joining Meatable in its mission to address the
world's most pressing challenges. We see a smart start-up that has
accomplished a lot in a short amount of time. They have a great team and
game-changing technology that can address the challenges around the
global food insecurity issues our planet is facing," said Klausner.
"They have all the right ingredients to become the leading choice for
sustainably and efficiently produced meat."

Meatable's proprietary platform technology enables a fundamentally more
cost effective and scalable production process. It replicates the
natural process of fat and muscle growth, in proportions that emulate
traditional cuts of meat. The entire process, when fully developed, is
expected to take only weeks to produce meat, whereas it takes years to
grow a live animal.

"To be able to meet the growing demand for meat worldwide, we need
breakthrough solutions. Cultivated meat has the potential to continue to
produce the product we love -- meat -- using a much more efficient
production process. Having Rick Klausner, Jeffrey Leiden, Section 32 and
DSM Venturing support us in realizing that potential is a huge step for
Meatable," said [Krijn de Nood](https://www.meatable.com/), CEO and
co-founder of Meatable. "We are honored to welcome a like-minded group
of investors who support us on our mission -- to develop, accelerate and
bring to life sustainable, healthy and environmentally sound
technologies that can improve the human condition. With this funding we
believe we are well on our way to bringing our first products to market
to sustainably satisfy the world's appetite for meat."

Meatable aims to produce cultivated meat, for which no animals are
slaughtered, fewer GHG emissions are released, and significantly less
land and water are required. And, unlike plant-based alternatives, the
end-product will provide the full experience of eating actual meat, with
the same texture, taste, and nutritional benefits.

After successfully completing its first pork showcase product, Meatable
is currently focused on the further development of cultivated pork and
beef. Meatable's technology is adaptable to any cell-based species,
including cows, pigs, sheep, and fish, giving the company great
opportunity for further product development.
