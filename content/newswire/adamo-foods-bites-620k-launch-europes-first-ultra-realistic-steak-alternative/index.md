LONDON, 22⁠ September---Adamo Foods has won triple backing in a boost to
its mission to develop delicious, healthy and sustainable alternatives
to meat whole-cuts from fungi.

The London-based food tech brand first secured a Smart Grant from
Innovate UK, the UK government research and innovation department's
highly competitive flagship award.

The company then secured its first VC investment from Beeches Group, a
prolific food and agriculture investment fund backed by the owners of
Noble Foods.

Building on its success, Adamo Foods has now been selected as winner of
the SHAKE Climate Change 2022 cohort, a prestigious annual competition
led by World-renowned Rothamsted Research that seeks to support the most
promising innovations in sustainable food production.

The company is using the funding to complete its development of Europe's
first convincing beef steak alternative. Pierre Dupuis, Founder and CEO
said:

*"It's a hugely exciting time in the alt-protein space, with meat
alternatives more popular than ever. But we see a huge gap in the market
for realistic and healthy alternatives to whole cuts. Whole cuts
represent 85% of the \$1trn meat market but are virtually absent in meat
alternatives. We're aiming to change that."*

'Whole cuts' refers to steaks and filets as opposed to shredded pieces
of meat such as burgers and nuggets.

Adamo Foods is using a proprietary fermentation process to create
clean-label whole-cut "steaks" based on a single, natural superfood
called fungal mycelium. Adamo Foods' mycelium strain is packed with
fiber, is a complete protein source with all 9 essential amino acids,
and is inherently fibrous, delivering a unique muscle-like structure.

*"We're working on an exciting new technology to take these products to
the next level, and are hugely grateful to our new investors for
recognising its potential. The funding takes us one step further on our
mission to remove animals from our broken food system."*

The company plans to pilot launch its first product in a limited number
of UK locations in 2023. Learn more at:
