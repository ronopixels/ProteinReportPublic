SAN FRANCISCO (September 2, 2020) -- Eat Just, Inc., a company that
applies cutting-edge science and technology to create healthier, more
sustainable foods, today announced the largest expansion yet for its
award-winning plant-based egg. By the end of the month, JUST Egg will be
available at more than 17,000 points of retail distribution in the
United States, a 40% increase and a testament to the breakout success of
the pioneering product that launched nationwide last year.

Walmart will add the original 12-ounce pourable JUST Egg -- perfect for
scrambles, omelets, quiches, stir-fries and a variety of baking
applications -- to more than 1,900 stores coast-to-coast after it became
a strong seller at hundreds of regional locations. About 900 Food
Lion stores in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S. and 170 Giant
stores in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington,
D.C. are also adding the product to their shelves.

More than 1,000 Kroger and Kroger-owned stores like Ralphs, Fred Meyer,
QFC, Fry\'s and Mariano\'s will bring the recently launched folded JUST
Egg to their freezer sections. Ideal on toast or inside breakfast
sandwiches, folded JUST Egg will also arrive at 1,000 Albertsons
and Safeway stores in Arizona, California, Colorado and Washington;
Jewel-Osco stores in the Greater Chicago area; Randalls and Tom Thumb in
Texas; and 160 Acme stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New
Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.

Original JUST Egg is the fifth best-selling egg out of 88 SKUs at a
leading national retailer, and its growth has surpassed numerous
mainstream plant-based products in popular categories like meat and milk
in conventional grocery. Folded JUST Egg is the #1 frozen breakfast item
at a top-five retailer -- likely the first time ever that a plant-based
protein has achieved #1 in category status in a major grocery store.
Folded JUST Egg is also the #1 frozen breakfast item in the natural
channel according to SPINS, the leading provider of data and insights
for natural, organic and specialty products.

\"Bringing JUST Egg to thousands of additional cities and towns across
America is a proud moment for our team. Knowing its now available at the
grocery store just a few miles from where I grew up in Birmingham,
Alabama is particularly exciting for me. Our products are quickly
becoming part of the breakfast ritual for families across the
country and we look forward to sharing JUST Egg with millions more in
the months and years ahead," said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of
Eat Just.

JUST Egg retail sales have skyrocketed in the past six months with
consumers eating at home more frequently and opting to add healthier and
more sustainable plant-based products to their diets. Overall JUST Egg
MULO (multi-outlet) unit sales were up 102% February to July. Unit sales
are up 102% at a leading grocery chain; up 105% at a leading mass
retailer; and up 253% at a leading natural retailer. Case shipments to
retail customers in July increased 170% over February and shipments
since July are up 330% versus the same time last year.

\"We are very grateful to all of our customers for their support
of both original JUST Egg and folded JUST Egg. I\'m excited to see how
quickly we've gained distribution and look forward to continuing to
build on this success together,\" said Matt Riley, Senior Vice President
for Global Partnerships at Eat Just.

Earlier this week, Eat Just [shared the results of a
survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200901005343/en/Americans-Plant-Based-Breakfast-New-Study-Finds) of
2,000 Americans conducted by market research firm OnePoll that found
more consumers are going plant-based for breakfast versus other meals
and more than half look for high protein and low sugar options when
making breakfast choices. Six in 10 said they liked the plant-based
version of a food product better than its animal-based counterpart and
more than half said they believe eggs made from plants are healthier
than eggs made by chickens.

The egg set is the fastest growing plant-based category by far --
outpacing milk, meat, cheese, yogurt and other products. Dollar sales of
plant-based eggs grew 192% in the past year and 228% over the past two
years, according to the Good Food Institute, and Eat Just owns about 99%
of the category.
