-   CellX and Tofflon will build China\'s first pilot facility for
    cultivated meat
-   The facility will allow CellX to scale up its suspension cell lines
    in serum-free media at thousand-liter scale
-   The facility will be China\'s first \"transparent food space\" for
    cultivated meat R&D, pilot production, and public tasting

Shanghai, February 5, 2023 --- On February 1st, CellX (Shanghai Shiwei
Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and Tofflon (Shanghai Tofflon Science and
Technology Co., Ltd.) signed a strategic partnership agreement with
Xiaodong Zheng (Chairman of Tofflon) and Ziliang Yang (Co-founder and
CEO of CellX) representing both companies. They will work together in
the field of cultivated meat, developing innovative equipment and
building a pilot production plant, as well as local and global
facilities for commercial production.

The two companies hope to leverage CellX's technical expertise in
cultivated meat and Tofflon's extensive biological equipment &
production capability to accelerate the scaling up of CellX's cultivated
meat products.

During the signing event, CellX and Tofflon shared the rendering of
China\'s first pilot facility for cultivated meat. The plant will allow
CellX to scale up its suspension cell lines in serum-free media at
thousand-liter scale. It will also be equipped with Tofflons' digital
and intelligent equipment management systems.

The facility will host multiple thousand-liter bioreactors and will
provide an interactive space for consumers to taste CellX's demo
products. It will be China\'s first \"transparent food space\" for
cultivated meat R&D, pilot production, and public tasting, and will be
completed within a year.

Mr. Zheng delivered a speech at the event, expressing his firm beliefs
in the cultivated meat industry and CellX's R&D progress.

\"CellX is the leading cultivated meat company in China. It has built
R&D platforms across the four major technological pillars of cultivated
meat - cell line development, media optimization, novel bioprocess
design, and end product innovation. Cultivated meat is a promising
application of biotechnology in the field of food tech. With the
experience and expertise accumulated in the field of biopharma and food
production, Tofflon will help CellX to speed the scaling up of its
cultivated meat products and it hopes to contribute to a sustainable
future for human kind\", he said.

Mr. Yang also shared CellX's latest R&D progress and strategic plans for
the future. \"Besides being the world's largest meat market, China is
also an emerging leader in the field of bio-manufacturing. Thanks to its
booming biotech industry, China is quickly building a strong
infrastructure and supply chain. Tofflon is one of the world\'s leading
providers of comprehensive solutions for drug and food manufacturing,
and their equipment and technologies can be quickly applied to the field
of cultivated meat.

\"As part of our strategic partnership, the construction of a pilot
facility is the cornerstone of CellX\'s journey to scale up cultivated
meat production in China. I look forward to working with Tofflon to
bring cultivated meat to consumers in China and around the world\", Yang
said.

As a branch of cellular agriculture, cultivated meat produces animal
meat directly from animal cells in large-scale bioreactors. This new
production method is more efficient and sustainable than traditional
factory farming methods.

In the future, CellX and Tofflon will work together to bring cultivated
meat to consumers in China and around the world.
