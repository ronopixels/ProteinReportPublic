**Brussels, 3rd December 2021**: Cellular Agriculture Europe, the newly
established association representing the cellular agriculture industry
in Europe, held this week its first General Assembly meeting. These
companies are making the same foods Europeans love in a new way.
Cellular agriculture requires only a small sample of animal cells to
grow meat, fish, and oils without growing the whole animal.

The meeting was the occasion to elect the Board of Directors of the
association and to agree on the mission of Cellular Agriculture Europe:
to bring together producers of cultivated meat, seafood, ingredients,
and products with stakeholders to find common ground and speak with a
shared voice for the good of the industry, consumers, and regulators.

The General Assembly comprising 13 member companies\* elected the
following five representatives on the Board of Directors:

-   Chris Dammann, Chief Operating Officer (Bluu Biosciences)
-   Etienne Duthoit, CEO and Co-Founder (Vital Meat)
-   Robert E. Jones, Head of Public Affairs (Mosa Meat)
-   Beth Loberant, Head of Regulatory Affairs (SuperMeat)
-   Hélène Miller, Head of European Affairs (Aleph Farms)

Mr. Robert E. Jones was appointed President of the Board and stated: *'I
am excited and honoured to serve as the first President of Cellular
Agriculture Europe. Addressing the role the food system plays in the
climate crisis is a pressing need. Cellular agriculture will add a
powerful tool to the collective effort to create a healthier and greener
food system in Europe.'*

In order to make this essential transition possible, innovation must be
integrated within the existing agri-food ecosystem. The successful
introduction of cellular agriculture adds a powerful new tool to achieve
the goals in Horizon Europe and the Farm to Fork strategy and, in
combination with reforms to conventional agriculture practices, the
cellular agriculture industry will play an integral role in the success
of the European Green Deal. *'We believe in a future where cellular
agriculture, in combination with sustainability reforms to conventional
agricultural practices, helps Europe meet its growing demand for protein
while giving consumers the opportunity to choose delicious and safe meat
and seafood products'*, concluded Mr. Jones.
