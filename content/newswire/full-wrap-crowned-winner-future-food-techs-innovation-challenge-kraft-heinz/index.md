**The Kraft Heinz Challenge**: Unlock the power of Beanz with solutions
that bring beans or pulses as an application or ingredient to the menu
of its consumers.

Over 120 innovators from around the world submitted their solutions to
solve the challenge set by Kraft Heinz.

After an in-depth review and judging process, the team at Kraft Heinz
selected three finalists for the Innovation Challenge Finale to present
their solution to the judge, **Erik-Jan Ransdorp**, *International
Director R&D Better Meals & EMEA* at **Kraft Heinz** and summit audience
at Future Food-Tech on September 30.

**Full Wrap** has created an innovative gluten-free tortilla made of
sprouted legumes that is also flexible, easy to use and full of whole
protein and is developing products including legumes tortillas made of
orange lentils, chickpeas, green buckwheat and green peas.

Commenting on the Innovation Challenge, **Erik-Jan Ransdorp** said: "We
were really impressed by all submissions, and really enjoyed the process
of reviewing. The pitches of the finalists were hugely energizing. We
were humbled by the commitment and excitement the finalists showed. It
proved once again that PASSION is an important key to unlock success!"

Reflecting on the winner, **Erik-Jan Ransdorp** shared: "The winner is
Full Wrap. In particular the use of sprouting to reduce negative side
effects of beans consumption were highly appreciated by the jury: a
natural process to unlock the power of a natural product like legumes is
hugely relevant in the market place globally. Super on trend and a
wonderful breakthrough idea!"

**Oliver Katz**, *Conference Producer* at Future Food-Tech said: "We
have been impressed by the talent and diversity of fresh solutions
presented by ambitious innovators with entries spanning 26 countries.
Congratulations to Full Wrap. We can't wait to hear more from them over
the coming months."

The other two finalists selected to pitch were: **Cuzena** and
**JaziLupini.**
