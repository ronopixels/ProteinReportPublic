[Novel Farms, Inc. ](https://novelfarms.co/)(the Company), a food
technology startup based in Berkeley, California, unveils today the
first-ever marbled cultivated pork loin.

Cultivated meat is poised to help relieve the strain on our food system
by providing a supply of animal protein while offering human health,
environmental, and animal welfare benefits. While the vast majority of
cultivated meat companies focus on making sausages or burgers, producing
meat that mimics conventional meat cuts is currently extremely difficult
--- only a handful of companies in the world have been able to showcase
pork or beef structured prototypes. Novel Farms now joins this select
group by creating a cultivated pork loin that displays the marbling and
texture of a real muscle cut.

Novel Farms solves the structuring problem by developing a proprietary
microbial fermentation approach to produce low-cost, edible, and highly
customizable scaffolds. Their tissue development platform gives them an
important and unique advantage by not only providing them with the
capability to structure meat from any animal species but also doing it
in a very cost-effective way. While scaffolding biomaterials such as
alginate need to undergo costly functionalization to ensure effective
cell attachment, their scaffolding process completely bypasses this
step, reducing production costs by 99.27% and thus accelerating the path
to the commercialization of their products at price parity. 

The founder team, Nieves Martinez Marshall, PhD, and Michelle Lu, PhD,
met while working as postdoctoral scientists in the Molecular and Cell
Biology department at the University of California at Berkeley prior to
launching the company in 2020. Their combined experience of over 30
years in research was key in the ideation of an elegant and unique
structuring approach for producing cultivated meat, which has been
awarded a highly competitive grant from the National Science Foundation
through the [*Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)* Program (phase
I)](https://www.sbir.gov/node/2083261) in 2021.

"Our goal is to accelerate the widespread adoption of cultivated meat
and its benefits by producing 'hard-to-resist' whole muscle cuts," said
Nieves Martinez Marshall. "Therefore, we need to be able to fulfill
consumer demand by delivering cultivated meat with the same fibrous
texture and mouthfeel as conventional cuts from an animal."

Novel Farms has raised US\$1.4 million in a pre-seed round with
participation of Big Idea Ventures, Joyance, Social Starts, Sustainable
Food Ventures, Good Startup, CULT foods and strategic angel investors.

\"We have worked with Novel Farms from their earliest days and are
excited about what they have accomplished in the cultivated meat
category. They have always tackled the scale-up challenges with fresh
and novel approaches and Big Idea Ventures is glad to support them
throughout their journey as true innovation leaders. Novel Farms are
ones to watch, support and partner with as they bring sustainable
protein to the world market, said Andrew D. Ive, Managing General
Partner for Big Idea Ventures.
