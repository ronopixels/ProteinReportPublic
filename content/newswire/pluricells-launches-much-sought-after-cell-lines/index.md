Nottingham-based bio-technology organisation,
[PluriCells](http://www.pluricells.co.uk), is pleased to announce the
official launch of their high-quality, fully traceable, pluripotent
animal stem cell lines available under research and commercial licence
from the [University of
Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/research/impact/technology-transfer.aspx). 

PluriCells' innovative processes **harness the efficiency of nature** to
create embryonic stem cell lines which are of significant benefit to the
cultured meat industry as it looks to overcome the challenges of scale.
The methodology used in the PluriCells process was pioneered by
PluriCells' Chief Research Scientist, [Professor Ramiro
Alberio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramiro-alberio-53981935/) and
[Professor Austin
Smith](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/livingsystems/team/director/),
and has since been peer-reviewed in [the
study](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/148/23/dev199901/273644/Pluripotent-stem-cells-related-to-embryonic-disc),
'*Pluripotent stem cells related to embryonic disc exhibit common
self-renewal requirements in diverse livestock species*'.

Cultured, or cultivated, meat is meat grown directly from animal cells
without the need to raise and slaughter animals and has the potential to
transform the way in which meat is consumed, for the good of our planet.
The industry, though nascent, is growing and governments worldwide are
estimated to have [invested around \$635 million into the alternative
protein
ecosystem](https://gfi.org/resource/alternative-proteins-state-of-global-policy/#:~:text=Governments%20increased%20their%20financial%2C%20political,climate%2C%20and%20global%20food%20system)
in 2022.

At present, cultured meat producers use a variety of cell types, with
adult stem cells most used according to the [Good Food Institute APAC's
recent
report](https://gfi-apac.org/cell-line-development-and-utilisation-trends-in-the-cultivated-meat-industry/),
'*Cell line development and utilisation trends in the cultivated meat
industry*'. They further note that for 'terrestrial species, this is
likely driven---at least in part---by challenges in procuring and
culturing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs)'. While adult stem cells are in common use, their replication
limits can create issues for precision manufacturing at scale.

PluriCells solves this issue through the provision of embryonic stem
cells from pigs, sheep and cattle which are developed at food standard,
free from genetic modification and which have genetic and phenotypic
stability proven beyond 200 replications. This latter feature makes them
effectively immortal. 

Professor Alberio, Chief Research Scientist, says:

"The world is becoming increasingly aware that our meat-eating habits
need to change. While cellular agriculture could give consumers new
alternatives for their meat consumption, cultivated meat production has
not yet achieved scalability or price parity. Both of which are crucial
to long-term adoption of cultivated meat products. Our cell lines have
been developed to drive efficiency and consistency in cultured meat
production to support this emerging industry at scale."

He adds:

"With our product lines already licensed by multiple leading cultured
meat producers in the UK, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the United States,
we're confident that PluriCells will become a leading provider of
pluripotent animal stem cell lines for the cultured meat industry
throughout the world."

The [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), known
globally for its expertise in biosciences and the development of
research into the future of food, has provided Professor Alberio's
research laboratory with the opportunity to take this innovative
development and create the commercial PluriCells product line. A
framework which is, in and of itself, innovative.

[Jack Bobo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackbobo/), Director of the
newly formed [Food Systems
Institute](https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/futurefood/2023/07/05/goodbye-to-the-future-food-beacon-and-welcome-to-the-food-systems-institute/),
says:

"With the creation of the new Food Systems Institute (part of The
University of Nottingham), we're excited to see how else other
organisations in this space can collectively solve the challenges facing
the future of food and look forward to the next innovation from
PluriCells."

**About Professor Ramiro Alberio**

Ramiro graduated as a veterinarian from La Plata University (Argentina),
and completed his PhD in Munich (Germany). During his postdoc, he
developed novel methods of cellular reprogramming and now focuses his
research on determining how cell fate decisions are made during the
development of mammalian embryos. The use of single cell transcriptomics
combined with gene editing to reveal the mechanisms that control cell
fate specification during early development in domestic animals led to
the creation of the process PluriCells now uses. These new methodologies
for the derivation of embryonic stem cells in domestic animals have
great potential for enhancing genetic selection of livestock, and in the
generation of lab-grown food products.

**About PluriCells**

Pluricells was created in late 2022 to supply high-quality, traceable
and stable pluripotent stem cell lines from sheep, pigs and cattle to
the cultured meat industry under research or commercial license through
The University of Nottingham. 2023 has seen PluriCells develop its
product range for the cultured meat market following successful supply
to a select number of leading cultured meat producers.
