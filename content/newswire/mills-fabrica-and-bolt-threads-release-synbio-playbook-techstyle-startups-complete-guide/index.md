**The report includes crucial tips for those looking to start synbio
businesses, an industry that has received billions in funding throughout
this year alone.**

**11 Nov. 2020** -- As the platform for nurturing global techstyle
innovations, [The Mills Fabrica](http://www.themillsfabrica.com/) is
partnering with global leading biomaterials innovator, [Bolt
Threads](https://boltthreads.com/) to launch a new report titled
"**Synbio Playbook for Techstyle Startups** **-- A Complete Guide for
Founders"**. Synthetic Biology ("Synbio"), which first entered the
market a few years ago and continues to receive substantial interest
from brands and corporations, is an area of science that involves the
design and construction of biological components/systems that do not
already exist in the natural world. This interdisciplinary field
combines many disciplines, from engineering to biology, to create
biomanufacturing methods that are better, cheaper, more efficient and
more sustainable.

Unhampered by the coronavirus pandemic, synbio startups raised over \$3
billion in funding in the first half of 2020 alone.

"We are thrilled to work with Bolt Threads to help support and build out
a global community of synbio innovators and partners. With the growth of
more synbio startups, the industry has started to see leading innovators
merge in the fashion/food sectors. Through the launch of this report, we
hope to create a guide that highlights the best practices and tips for
early-stage founders, to provide startups with the necessary knowledge
and resources to transform and scale their technologies for
commercialization and industry impact," said Alexander Chan, Co-Director
of The Mills Fabrica.

The report is a guidebook for synbio innovators looking to start and
grow a business, offering key information in five focus areas:

-   **Strategy and position setting**
-   **Scaling up technology**
-   **Go-to-market**
-   **Fundraising and exit trajectory**
-   **Engaging with the wider synbio ecosystem**

Founders will also find the guide especially resourceful, as it outlines
critical pathways to scale a synbio business, including adopting the
right manufacturing, developing effective product launch strategies and
understanding the wider set of supporting ecosystem partners. Investors
interested in entering the synbio space will learn the latest innovation
trends and investment insights, as well as exit opportunities within the
field.

The report synthesizes learnings and findings from The Mills Fabrica's
engagement with multiple food/fashion tech startups and portfolio
companies as well as Bolt Threads' expertise and experience in scaling
up synbio technologies to go-to market. The report also highlights
learnings from case studies of successful innovators such as Impossible
Foods, Perfect Day and Renewcell, sharing industry-related challenges
and tips.

"As we grew Bolt Threads, we had the opportunity to learn from those who
came before us, and we also learned quite a few lessons of our own along
the way which we are honored to pay forward to the next generation,"
said David Breslauer, Bolt Threads Chief Scientific Officer and
Co-Founder. "The Mills Fabrica has been at the forefront of supporting
the young and growing SynBio-Fashion industry, and we were happy to help
them put together this playbook for all the new companies that will
continue to revolutionize the field."
