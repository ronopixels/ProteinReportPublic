*Company will increase monthly production capacity to 150 tons and
expand R&D team with fresh backing from Phystech Ventures and Lever VC,
as Russian plant-based meat market begins to boom*

Fast-growing Russian plant-based meat startup Welldone announced today
the close of a \$1.5 million funding round to significantly expand
production capacity to meet the company's rapid growth in sales. The
round was led by Phystech Ventures, an international fund investing in
deep tech startups globally, with participation from Lever VC, a leading
global investor in the alternative protein category. The funding will be
used to accelerate Welldone's R&D, launch additional product lines, and
increase production capacity to up to 150 tons per month.

The plant-based category is beginning to grow quickly in Russia. Sales
of plant-based milk have grown sevenfold in the past two years on
record, reaching 12 million liters of production in 2019. Plant-based
meat has now begun to grow quickly as well, with the Russian
Agricultural Bank projecting it will account for 1.5% of the entire meat
category within four years, or 140,000 tons annually

Since launching in September of last year, sales of Welldone's 
plant-based burgers and mince  have expanded to more than 500 points of
sale in 50 cities across Russia, including listings at five  national
retail chains and another five leading eGrocery companies. Welldone's
deep R&D work has allowed it to produce high quality products at
competitive pricing (\$3 for 2 patty pack vs \$16 for an international
brand), and get on restaurant menus along with major international
plant-based meat brands. Welldone is the first local company in the
region to leverage high-moisture extrusion to deliver high quality
texture for realistic plant-based meat products. The funding will be
used to grow distribution in Moscow and other regions, as well as to
expand its international distribution, which already includes Belarus
and Kazakhstan.

"Today more and more people in Russia are starting to think about their
diet," said Welldone CEO Alexander Kiselev. "They understand that there
are ingredients in animal meat which are not good for them, such as
cholesterol. The plant-based market is poised to grow very quickly in
Russia and Eastern Europe, and with our significant investment in R&D,
world-class yet affordable products, and partnership with Phystech
Ventures and Lever VC, we look forward to leading the growth of the
category."

"Welldone's key advantages include an experienced team, deep R&D
expertise, and strong collaboration with the country\'s leading food
biotech institutes," said Phystech Ventures Principal Anna Gishko. "With
excellent scientific talent available in the country and much lower
input costs, the efficiency of R&D in Russia is an important competitive
advantage for international expansion."
