***Tallinn, Estonia, 11 May 2023 ---*** ***Gelatex Technologies, a
materials technology company enabling industrial tissue engineering and
cell culture, has received a grant of 760,000 euros from the Estonian
Business and Innovation Agency to develop edible microcarriers and
microcarrier production technologies for industrial cellular agriculture
and cultured meat.***

Microcarriers are a crucial component in the production of cultured
meat, a process that involves growing animal cells in bioreactors to
produce animal meat without the need for animal slaughter. However, the
current microcarriers used mostly in the pharma industry are synthetic
and inedible, therefore not suitable for cultured meat production. The
market faces also several other challenges, including high cost, poor
scalability, and low cell attachment and proliferation rates.

Gelatex\'s nanofibrous scaffolds and microcarriers provide a solution to
these challenges, with a 90% cost reduction and better cell migration
and adhesion properties. Gelatex\'s microcarriers are highly porous,
edible (GRAS ingredients), and animal-free, making them ideal for hybrid
or fully cell-cultured meat. They are also validated for cell adhesion,
proliferation, and stability, suitable for muscle, connective, and
adipose tissue, and non-degradable versions are suitable for cellular
agriculture suspended bioreactors. Various cell lines, including pork,
poultry, beef, fish, mollusks, and other cell lines, have been
successfully cultured in Gelatex\'s microcarriers and scaffolds.

Furthermore, Gelatex\'s patented halospinning technology creates a 3D
structure that imitates the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) better
than alternative solutions, leading to a cell adhesion rate that on
average is more than 80%, and reducing overall production costs.

The application of microcarriers is not limited to cultured meat.
Microcarriers are also used in the production of vaccines, and
regenerative medicine, as well as in drug discovery and screening.
Gelatex\'s microcarriers have the potential to disrupt these industries
by providing a more efficient, cost-effective and scalable alternative
to traditional microcarrier solutions.

\"With this grant, we aim to finalize our microcarrier recipes and
optimize production technologies,\" said Märt-Erik Martens, CEO of
Gelatex Technologies. \"We are thrilled to receive this grant from the
Estonian Business and Innovation Agency to further our work in
developing highly efficient microcarriers and microcarrier production
technologies for industrial cellular agriculture and cultured meat. Our
nanofibrous scaffolds and microcarriers provide better cell migration
and adhesion properties for cultured meat, wound care, and drug
development companies, turning industrial tissue engineering and cell
culture into a reality.\"

Gelatex Technologies has already received support from notable investors
such as Techstars, Change Ventures, Crosslight Partners, Lifely VC,
Climate Capital, Juha Rantala, and Christian Stiebner. The company is
also raising additional funding to enter from piloting and R&D to the
commercial phase and set up an ISO-certified production facility.

*Gelatex Technologies is an experienced materials technology company
from Estonia and the inventor of cost-effective technology for nanofiber
production called halospinning. Their scalable platform technology
enables the implementation of nanofibers in applications that were
inapproachable until now such as scaffolds for cell-cultured meat,
scar-reducing wound care materials, bio-based filtration materials, and
more. Gelatex was founded in 2016 and has raised €2.5M in dilutive and
non-dilutive funding.*
