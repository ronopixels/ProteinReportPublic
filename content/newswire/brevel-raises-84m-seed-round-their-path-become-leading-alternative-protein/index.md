**Tel Aviv, June 2, 2022 --** Brevel, the leading microalgae-based
alternative protein company, today announced it has raised \$8.4M in a
Seed funding round. The funding will be utilized to build a commercial
pilot factory which will serve as the basis for scaling Brevel's
proprietary technology and enhancing R&D capabilities. The
alternative-protein's dedicated investors include FoodHack, Good Startup
VC, Tet Ventures and Nevateam Ventures among other prominent investors
from the food tech industry. The round also includes significant funding
from the EU's prestigious program Horizon2020 and Israel's Innovation
Authority in the form of non-dilutive grants. 

Founded in 2017, Brevel is actively working to solve the biggest
nutrition challenges that exist today. The company is achieving this by
providing truly sustainable plant-based protein which is both color and
flavor neutral, and available the first time at an **affordable** cost
for the food industry. Brevel uses non-GMO microalgae grown in a unique
breakthrough technology which enables the highest quality of sustainable
protein production at cost levels comparable to pea and soy, the leading
sources of plant based protein today. 

The current alternative protein market has many problems when it comes
to cost, flavor, functionality, quality and sustainability. Microalgae
are the ultimate source of protein in terms of sustainability, but
unfortunately the existing options for microalgae as an alternative
protein have very high costs and flavor barriers. Brevel's solution for
microalgae-based protein has managed to solve these challenges.

Brevel's technology is the first globally to combine sugar-based
fermentation of microalgae with a high concentration of light at
industrial scales. The result is a protein that will be price
competitive with pea and soy and is color and flavor neutral. Brevel's
protein solves immediate challenges in plant-based dairy and egg
products that lack a valuable nutritional profile due to the need for
very mildly flavored protein sources. Due to the high nutritional values
and sustainable production in the mid and long terms, Brevel is aiming
to become the #1 choice for plant-based protein worldwide.

"For the first time Brevel will be providing a truly sustainable
solution which is not only tasty and blends perfectly into different
food applications to increase their nutritional value, but is also at an
affordable cost which puts it on the path for global-scale mainstream
adoption." said Yonatan Golan, CEO and Co-Founder of Brevel. "As early
as Q4 2022, Brevel's first commercial factory will provide a solution
that the food industry has been waiting for for too long". 

\"Seeing Brevel\'s achievements over the last few years, we are
convinced that Brevel not only has great product-market fit, but that
they have what it takes to become a market leader," said Arman Anaturk,
CEO and Co-Founder of FoodHack. "Brevel\'s scalable solution has the
potential to help millions of people around the world eat dairy-free
products that have excellent nutritional values at the right price. Our
decision to invest in Brevel is an easy one and we are pleased to
support Yonatan and his team on the journey.\"

Brevel's technology is based on high-tech indoor, sterile and fully
automated systems which are illuminated from within at high intensity.
The unique process enables the production of microalgae at a cost
reduction of more than 90% and includes nutrient rich ingredients and
functionalities that are only produced in the presence of light. Now
with the closing of their Seed funding round, conditions are finally
ripe for the next stage of mass production.

**About Brevel**

affordable, flavor and color neutral, highly functional, sustainable and
at consistent and scalable production. Thanks to Brevel's unique
proprietary technology breakthrough the future of nutrition will be

including equity and non-dilutive grants such as the prestigious
Horizon2020 grant. Brevel was founded by three brothers Yonatan (CEO),
