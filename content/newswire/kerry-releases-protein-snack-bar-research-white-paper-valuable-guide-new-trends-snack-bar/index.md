***"Choosing the Right Protein for Your Snack Bar" provides protein bar
and snack manufacturers with the latest, most advanced research
information to guide their development of protein bars to address this
rapidly expanding market***

**Naas, Ireland, November 13, 2020** --- Kerry, the Taste & Nutrition
company, is pleased to release a research white paper on the exciting
emerging topic of protein snack bar development and manufacture.
Entitled "**Choosing the Right Protein for Your Snack Bar***,"* the
paper examines the rapidly expanding market for snack bars that provide
a quality hit of protein and a wide variety of new tastes. In addition,
the paper reviews the latest trends in consumer preference in the area
of ingredients and bar tastes, important trends and regional regulations
in formulation, and the application of plant, dairy and mixed protein in
new bar concepts.

"Snackification" --- the movement toward snacking versus eating distinct
meals --- had already been on the rise prior to COVID-19, leading
consumers to begin paying much more attention to the nutritional value
of snacks. Since the onset of the pandemic, however, consumers have
naturally started to feel more vulnerable; this in turn has accelerated
a desire to incorporate more healthier foods into their diets as a means
to support long-term health goals. Throughout this pandemic, we've seen
the public rushing to stock up on snacks, whether for a quick and
convenient source of nutrition or to provide comfort during these highly
challenging times.

Breaking it down further, the appeal of protein specifically --- an
important nutritional element in health and wellness --- has led sales
of snack bars with "high" or "added" protein claims to grow
exponentially as a category: in 2019 alone, the sector was valued at a
remarkable US\$6 billion. Globally, snack bar launches featuring
high/added protein have moved from 17% in 2015 to 33% in 2019.

"We believe the upward trend in demand for protein-fortified snacks will
continue over the long term, driven by rejuvenated consumer interest in
healthy eating and underpinned by dynamic innovation in the category.
With new sources of protein being discovered continually and new
tastes/delivery formats constantly being innovated, snack bars' fortunes
have taken a noticeable turn upward," says Mindy Leveille, Strategic
Marketing Manager -- Proteins, Kerry.

"Sales of snack bars with high/added protein claims continue to rise as
consumers respond to a 'feel good' factor around purchasing snacks that
pack an added nutritional punch," adds Leveille. "Consumers everywhere
recognize the value of protein in snack-size portions, and protein-added
snack bars are a quick and convenient way for busy people to get a tasty
nutrition boost. Our R&D white paper provides a treasure trove of
information designed to assist bar manufacturers as they search for just
the right protein for their snack bar formulations."

**Key considerations for complex bar challenges**

There are a couple of considerations for bar product development to keep
top of mind: consumers want alternative plant protein sources; also,
there is a growing trend toward "flexitarian" proteins bars --- hybrids
that incorporate both plant and animal protein. While sustainability in
manufacturing is certainly valued, according to Mintel, it is also a
fact that as many as 75% of consumers believe taste is the *most
important* *factor* when purchasing a protein product. This is a concern
for high-protein content bars, as surveys have revealed that those with
health claims are less likely to be perceived as "good tasting" versus
comparable products without such assertions.

"There are many emerging ingredients and flavors to apply in protein
snack bars, ranging from coffee cold brew to mango to tomato & basil,
with the latter being a savory alternative to sweet cereal bars," said
Leveille. "Our white paper presents a number of protein bar concepts to
provide inspiration to bar developers for their next new product
development."

Having a clean label is another important concern for consumers, and the
advent of new and alternative proteins heralds an opportunity for snack
bar manufacturers to innovate and benefit by adopting simpler, clean
label formulations. This is especially important for protein bars with
high sugar content or those that have been highly processed. Brands are
now being pressured to reformulate with simpler ingredients, and to be
more transparent about on-pack information. The white paper is available
