developed the technology strategy and scientific approach for the
company, and as its CTO led the implementation of a technology platform
for cultivated fish. He built and led the R&D team, while also managing
collaborations, IP, IT, and the establishment of a PMO. Before founding
BlueNalu Chris was Director of Science & Technology at the Invention
Development Fund of Intellectual Ventures. Other career stops include
the role of Sr. Scientist at BASF and multiple engagements as an
independent consultant focusing on tissue engineering, genomics, and
intellectual property. Chris holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology &
Genetics from the Free University of Berlin, Germany.

As COO at Bluu Biosciences, Chris will leverage his extensive know-how
and knowledge of the industry to ensure that the most effective and
efficient processes are implemented throughout the company. He will be
responsible for key areas including commercialization efforts, scale-up
strategy, collaboration management and IP.

\"With Chris, we have been able to attract a first-class expert and
innovation leader in cultivated fish to Bluu Biosciences. With his
extensive knowledge and experience as a founder, he is a valuable
addition to our leadership team. We are very pleased to welcome an
entrepreneur on board, who shares our values and our ambition to
revolutionize fish production,\" explained Dr Sebastian Rakers,

Chris Dammann emphasized: \"Bluu Biosciences has the scientific
excellence, technical concept and entrepreneurial vision that an
innovative start-up needs to become a competitive and successful company
in the global market. Bluu Biosciences' approach is unique, and I am
very excited to use my experience to guide the first cultivated fish
company in Europe towards market readiness.\"
