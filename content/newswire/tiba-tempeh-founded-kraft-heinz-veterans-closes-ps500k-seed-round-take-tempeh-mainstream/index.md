UK plant-based start-up Tiba Tempeh announced today it has closed a
£500k seed round to accelerate its growth as it prepares for listings
with major UK supermarkets and international expansion. The funding will
be used to launch new product innovation, grow the team, and support
marketing efforts to drive consumer awareness and trial of tempeh. The
investment round was taken by Lever VC, a leading global investor in the
alternative protein category whose partners are investors in Beyond
Meat, Impossible Foods, THIS, and many other category leaders.  

Tiba Tempeh was founded in 2019 by Alex and Ross Longton, food industry
veterans with 30 years of experience in senior sales and marketing
positions at Kraft Heinz and other food industry leaders. After
discovering the benefits of eating a plant-based diet the team wanted to
use their food industry experience to help people eat more naturally
healthy plant-based foods as they found a lack of such products in the
market. On a trip to Indonesia they discovered tempeh, a deliciously
natural plant-based protein made from soybeans using a special
fermentation process, and Tiba Tempeh was born.

Tiba Tempeh specialises in innovative tempeh products with the current
range including Sweet Chilli, Curry Spiced and Soy Marinade pieces that
are sold diced, marinated and ready to cook, making them a deliciously
convenient meat-free solution for stir-fries, curries, salads, wraps and
more.  The company also launched the first ever tempeh burger in UK
supermarkets. Unlike many other meat-free products Tiba Tempeh is made
with 100% natural ingredients and boasts over 22 grams of protein per
100g serving, a similar level to meat.  The range is also organic, high
in fibre, vegan and made with live cultures, tapping into the growing
trend towards gut health.

"Tempeh is a growing category opportunity for consumers who want more
natural meat alternatives, and Tiba is hands down the best tasting
tempeh product we've ever come across," said Nick Cooney, Managing
Partner of Lever VC. "We think Tiba Tempeh's very experienced team,
strong brand, exciting innovation and growth plans will position them to
be a leading global brand in the category." 

Meat-free has been the UK's fastest growing food category, growing 42%
year on year, with tempeh sales growing ahead of the category at 112%
year on year.  Since launching just over a year ago, Tiba Tempeh has
grown quickly and is already listed nationwide in the UK in stores such
as Ocado, Planet Organic, Whole Foods and Selfridges. The company has
also grown its direct to consumer sales, foodservice channel and
supplies to recipe box companies including Mindful Chef.

"We are extremely excited about our partnership with Lever VC, which
will accelerate our growth both in the UK and internationally," said
Alex Longton, Managing Director of Tiba Tempeh. "Lever VC's expertise in
the sector will add significant value to further scale the business and
help us on our mission to create a healthier world by inspiring people
to eat more naturally healthy and sustainable plant-based foods."
