Company reaches major milestones in commercializing cell-cultivated
animal protein

**HONG KONG -** Avant, the first cultivated meat company in China and
the first cultivated fish company in Asia, announces today a strategic
partnership with QuaCell, an emerging leader in the biopharmaceutical
industry in China.

This partnership will combine Avant's cell cultivation biotechnology
platform with QuaCell's 7,000 m2 ISO and GMP accredited facilities in
China, equipped with bioreactors up to 2,000 liters, supplying to
FDA-compliant customers globally.

Subsequent to a 90% cost reduction and reaching unit economics in
functional proteins with Avant's FBS-free cell culture media, this
partnership targets an additional 75% cost reduction from the current
level.  It is expected to be accomplished by converting ingredients to
food grade from pharma grade and by optimizing formula for large-scale
bioreactors.

By utilizing Quacell's industrial facilities, Avant will be able to
reduce capital expenditure and accelerate its scale-up by at least 12
months. Avant will own the intellectual property generated from this
partnership.

**Dr. Mario Chin, Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Avant** said,
"Optimizing serum-free media formula to a food grade environment
contributes vastly to scaling up, which is an important step to
industrializing our patent-pending cell cultivation technologies."

**Carrie Chan, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Avant** noted,
"The race for cost reduction amongst cultivated meats companies has
entered a new phase. With this partnership, we can leapfrog into a
larger scale sooner and can make a better CapEx plan ahead."

**Fai Poon, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, QuaCell**
remarked**, \"**We are excited about this partnership to work with Avant
to accelerate commercialization of cell-cultivated animal protein
leveraging on our infrastructure."
