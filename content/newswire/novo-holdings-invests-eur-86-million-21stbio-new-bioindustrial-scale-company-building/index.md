COPENHAGEN, DENMARK --- December 21, 2021. Novo Holdings, a leading
international life sciences investor, today announced a significant
investment in 21st.BIO A/S -- a new Danish bioindustrial scale-up
company.

Established in 2020, 21st.BIO has been founded with a mission to support
bioindustrial companies globally in upscaling from molecule innovation
to large-scale production to be able to meet market demands and thereby
advance the green transition globally. The focus areas of 21st.BIO
include producing proteins and peptides that can be utilised for the
food, materials and agricultural industries. It is estimated that as
much as 60% of the physical inputs to the global economy could be
produced biologically.

Today, much of the transformational bioindustrial innovation is never
commercialised because of the challenges that occur when production has
to be scaled from the lab processes to full-scale manufacturing. The
production environment in which the molecule was originally developed is
often unable to deliver the right quality and at acceptable cost levels.

A common issue facing innovators in industrial biotech is also a lack of
access to competencies and facilities to develop a molecule production
process that can deliver the desired quality at the cost levels required
to compete effectively.

**Thomas Schmidt, co-founder, and CEO of 21st.BIO, said:** "Many
brilliant industrial biotech ideas never succeed, because production
challenges result in too high price points for the final product. Hence,
a vast number of otherwise great innovations do not make it to a scale
at which they are truly relevant for the world. At 21st.BIO, we can help
establish the right technology for producing novel molecules and
peptides and hence help innovators successfully make the difficult step
from innovation to big business and impact for the planet. We have
gained access to a selection of Novozymes' unique technology platform on
commercial terms, which means that a success for 21st.BIO is also a
success for Novozymes."

The technology platform of 21st.BIO originates from selected parts of
Novo-zymes platform, which has been developed and perfected over the
past 40+ years.

Novozymes provides a co-exclusive licence to 21st.BIO within certain
boundaries of applications, ensuring Novozymes' ability to continue its
leadership position in the areas where Novozymes operates. 

**Claus Crone Fuglsang, Executive Vice President of Novozymes,
commented:** "A strong industrial biotech environment, supported by
enabling start-ups to bring innovation to scale, will help build future
markets. The entire industry will benefit from a thriving development of
new biological solutions. This is an opportunity to leverage our
technology in a different context and enable a transition to-wards a
biobased society and create further value -- also for Novozymes'
share-holders."

**New manufacturing site on the horizon**

Novo Holdings is investing EUR 86 million in 21st.BIO. Søren Møller,
Managing Partner of Novo Seeds, Novo Holdings, will join the Board of
Directors.

"I am very pleased to join 21st.BIO on its mission to help more
biological solutions reach the market and thereby enable the
acceleration of the green transition. The technology that 21st..BIO
offers addresses a critical, unmet global need, and I see great
potential for synergies and partnerships between 21st.BIO and other Novo
Holdings portfolio companies in the industrial biotech sector," **said
Søren Møller.**

21st.BIO currently operates in Denmark and California. The access to
selected parts of Novozymes R&D platform and the investment by Novo
Holdings will enable the company to expand its capacity further.

"With the access to a selected part of Novozymes technology platform and
financing from Novo Holdings, 21st.BIO will be able to grow and to
establish the first manufacturing site to serve our customers globally.
Further, with both Novo Holdings and Novozymes on board, we are getting
access to a broader network and knowledge base that is very
advantageous," **Thomas Schmidt said.**

**The technology explained**

21st.BIO helps customers optimising and developing the appropriate
expression platform for large-scale production of their particular
molecule by testing the molecule using various expression platforms,
such as fungi, yeast or bacteria. When the right expression platform has
been identified, 21st.BIO draws on its comprehensive strain bank and
selects and optimises the best-performing strains. This leads to an
optimised production platform that enables clients to produce their
product at commercially attractive costs and quantities.

To Novozymes, the opportunity base will materialise as 21st.BIO succeeds
with its projects, and revenue will be generated from licensing income
as technologies are commercialised.
