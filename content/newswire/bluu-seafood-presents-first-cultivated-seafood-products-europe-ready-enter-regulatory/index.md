**Berlin, August 09th, 2022**. Bluu Seafood, leading European Foodtech
to produce cultivated fish and seafood, has presented the first
market‐ready products made from cultivated fish cells. Their fish
fingers and fish balls contain cultivated fish cells as the main
ingredient and have been enriched with plant proteins to optimize
cooking behavior and mouthfeel.

The products have reached market readiness and will soon enter the
regulatory approval process. Bluu Seafood targets initial approval and
market launch in Singapore by the end of 2023, as the regulatory process
there is already well‐defined. The company will also apply for approval
in the US, the UK, and the EU.

In addition to fish balls and fish fingers, Bluu Seafood has also
developed first prototypes of more complex products such as fillets and
sashimi. The company\'s products are made using animal serum‐ free
growth media and are based on proprietary, non‐GMO trout and salmon cell
lines.

Founder and CEO Dr Sebastian Rakers explained, \"With the completion of
our first products, we can demonstrate visible and edible results after
less than two years of operational work. This officially makes us the
first company in Europe to produce cultivated fish. We are now working
closely with regulatory agencies to clear the way for market launch and
are using the time to focus on scaling.\"

Bluu Seafood combines cell and food technology to grow a variety of
sustainable, tasty seafood products directly from animal cells without
compromising animal welfare and with a significantly smaller
environmental footprint than conventional fishing.

\"Conventional seafood production has reached its limits as more than 90
percent of edible fish stocks are exploited to maximum levels, which
poses a serious threat to marine ecosystems. With Bluu Seafood, we can
make an important contribution to the supply of animal protein that
allows us to manage our oceans in a way that conserves resources and
hopefully also promotes biodiversity in this habitat that is so
important to all of us,\" Rakers emphasized.

**About Bluu Seafood**\
The food technology company Bluu Seafood (formerly Bluu Biosciences) is
the first company in Europe to specialize in the commercial production
of cultivated fish. As a pioneer at the intersection of biotechnology
and food technology, Bluu Seafood aims to produce healthy, sustainable,
and delicious cell‐cultured fish products. The aim is to produce fish
products in a sustainable and cost‐efficient manner, thus making a
significant contribution to securing the future supply of animal protein
to mankind. The food technology company, based in Berlin and with
scientific facilities in Lübeck, was founded in 2020 by Dr Sebastian
Rakers and Simon Fabich with an expert team of marine biologists, cell
biologists, tissue engineers and food engineers. In April 2021,
entrepreneur, and molecular biologist Dr Christian Dammann joined the
management team as Chief Operating Officer. Regarding research &
development, Bluu Seafood cooperates closely with Fraunhofer Institute
for Marine Biotechnology and Cell Technology (EMB; now Fraunhofer IMTE)
in Lübeck and has a state‐of‐the‐art R&D environment. More information
