*17 startups launching innovative solutions to feed the world*

**November 22,** **2021 ---** Big Idea Ventures, global leader in early
stage investing in the food technology sector, revealed its latest
accelerator cohorts today.

Seventeen early-stage startups were selected for pre-seed investment as
part of Big Idea Ventures' bi-annual accelerator program. Investments
were made through the firm's New York and Singapore offices and the
firm's newest office in Paris, which opened early 2021. Big Idea
Ventures' accelerator is part of its New Protein Fund (\$50M+ AUM),
dedicated to early stage investments in alternative protein products,
ingredients and technologies.

"Innovation in alternative proteins continues to advance globally," said
Andrew D. Ive, Founder and Managing General Partner of Big Idea
Ventures, "helping to solve big challenges with big ideas. The
entrepreneurs we support have real solutions to climate and food
challenges, Big Idea Ventures is investing in the best companies around
the world, and these developments could not arrive at a more critical
moment for us all."

The seventeen companies in Big Idea Ventures' latest accelerator cohorts
are developing and improving on protein alternatives across the value
chain:

*New York Accelerator* \-- *Cohort 4*

*"This year, we're seeing smart solutions to improve current
alternatives and expedite their time to market. Each company in our New
York program is addressing at least one barrier to mass-market
commercialization, from price and scalability to performance and
nutritional content." --- Mia Medicus, Program Director, BIV New York*

    proteins with up to 10x higher yields compared to wild type yields.
-   **BetterMilk** --- makes whole milk with mammary cells. BetterMilk's
    innovative genetic engineering platform allows for the dramatic
    reduction in the cost of lactation hormones and growth medium to
    bring their milk to price parity at launch. They are a B2B company
    who will sell their milk and milk ingredients to companies from the
    food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry.
-   **Liven Proteins** --- produces animal-free, functional protein

    origin-free dairy proteins and fats. Maya Milk\'s mission is to
    create dairy products structurally similar to animal derived
    counterparts, without compromising the sensory experience that
    consumers are accustomed to.

*Singapore Accelerator* \-- *Cohort* *4*

*"Singapore is at the forefront for regulatory approvals and
commercialisation of cell-based meats and alternative protein. Our
cohort is leading with cutting-edge innovations from indulgent foods,
cultivated exotic meat and surimi and a multitude of fermentation
solutions to produce sustainable protein." --- Dr. Dalal AlGhawas,
Program Director, BIV Singapore*

-   **Phyx44** --- is a cellular agriculture startup creating dairy
    alternatives using precision fermentation. Phyx44 is producing
    nature-identical, animal free dairy proteins & fats to recreate milk

-   **LILO** --- is a New Zealand fruit technology company creating
    permissibly indulgent snacks from low grade and waste fruit. LILO\'s
    hero product is a ready to eat plant based and gluten free
    cheesecake that is every bit as indulgent as it\'s dairy
    counterpart. LILO is working directly with New Zealand orchardists
    and strategic partners  the potential in unused produce and create a
    range of nutritionally superior products for on the go lifestyles.
-   **Fisheroo** --- is Southeast Asia's first cell-based fish company
    focusing on the \$5 billion huge surimi industry, and aims to create
    surimi at scale and sell it as an ingredient to existing surimi
    product manufacturers and potentially integrating with innovative
    plant-based companies. Fisheroo has  their proprietary cell line
    within their state-of-the-art facility based in Singapore and are on
    track to deliver a prototype within 2022.
-   **Mogale Meat** ---  is Africa's first cultivated game meat company,
