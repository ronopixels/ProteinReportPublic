**SHANGHAI** -- Yeyo coconut yogurt, produced by Chinese plant-based
diary pioneer Marvelous Foods Ltd., has hit the shelves across ALDI
China stores. In addition to offline stores, Yeyo is also available
through ALDI's WeChat mini program as well as on Meituan, China's
largest food delivery platform with over 30 million active daily users.

"We have been working hard to make Yeyo more accessible to consumers and
are very pleased to be able to do so on a whole new scale through ALDI's
network" says Marvelous Foods founder Christiana Zhu.

Yeyo is the first plant-based coconut yogurt to be stocked by ALDI in
China. It is being featured as a hero product in ALDI's 'healthy eating
challenge', a social media campaign that rides the new wave of health
and fitness conversations trending due to China's Olympic fever.

With zero dairy, sugar or artificial additives, Yeyo is a natural fit
with health and wellness. Yeyo has previously partnered with top fitness
and yoga brands including Lululemon and Maia Active on brand
activations, resulting in organic content posted by social media fitness
influencers with a combined following of over 6 million.

In the healthy eating challenge, ALDI highlights Yeyo as a great base to
be paired with various oat products for a healthy meal or snack. "We
have seen that this is a popular way to eat Yeyo," says Marvelous Foods
co-founder Athena Zhu. "A top fitness influencer once featured a recipe
for overnight oats using Yeyo that gained over 35,000 likes on the
Chinese social media platform RED."

Three of Yeyo's six flavors are now available for purchase at ALDI. They
include Yeyo's best-selling 'pure', and two granola-infused flavors
'peach crunch' and 'strawberry chocolate'.
