**SAN FRANCISCO, CA**, 04/16/2021: SVCMS, LLC, a California based
company focused on media and networking surrounding cell-cultured meat
and future food technology, announces a webinar series, CMS Astro,
planned for Thursday, April 29, 2021 to be held online and in a digital
format. In previous years, events hosted by the Cultured Meat Symposium
included scientists, researchers, key industry experts, investors, and
members of the traditional meat, poultry, and seafood industries. Past
sponsors of the Cultured Meat Symposium include Sartorius Stedim
Biotech, Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, Texture Technologies Corp,
Benchling, ORF Genetics, Black & Veatch, Chemometec, and Aleph Farms.

CMS Astro is a virtual symposium dedicated to the role of cell-cultured
meat technology in space. A single day of talks related to cell-based
meat technology in applications of outer space research, space travel,
and deep space exploration. Speakers include Hilde Stenui of Space
Applications, Scot Bryson of Orbital Farm, Gene Boland of Techshot,
Inc., Moritz Kompenhans, CellAg Germany, Shahreen Reza of Mission: Space
Food, Shayne Guiliano of 108 Labs, and more. Cell-cultured meat
technology, also referred to as cultivated meat, has been increasingly
popular since additional investment in cellular agriculture has topped
over \$1.5 Billion. SVCMS, LLC aims to continue the research and growth
of this new food technology sector through media, investments, and
events.

SVCMS will be hosting the fourth edition of their flagship event, the
