The [Industrializing Cell-Based Meats
Summit](https://industrializingcellbasedmeats.com/?utm_source=external-protein-report&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=14821-icbm-protein-report-press-release) returns
for the 2nd year to unite the world's leading minds from industry,
academia and regulation to share the latest scientific progress in
the field.

This industry-led forum joins key opinion leaders in the cellular
agricultural space to have an open, honest and science-based discussion
about key challenges in this field and to collaborate on how we can
overcome crucial bottlenecks, from scaling up complex processes to
producing sustainable, real-tasting meat.

Cell-based meat, poultry and seafood is being put forward as a solution
that will help fulfil the increased demand for meat as the global
population grows to 10 billion people by 2050. It will also provide
significant benefits for the environment, animal welfare and
public health.

In recent years, cultured meat products have gained momentum, with Mark
Post having produced the first cell-based beef hamburger in 2013,
Memphis Meats debuted the world's first cell-based meatball in 2016 and
more recently, JUST Inc. unveiled their lab-grown chicken nuggets in
October 2019. In between these, various companies have also revealed
prototypes including duck, steak, pork sausage, and fish cakes.

Investment in the space has skyrocketed, most recently with Dutch start
up Meatable raising €9M in a seed round that will allow them to host a
tasting of its first prototype of lab-grown pork by summer 2020.

As well as investment progress and huge technological leaps, there has
also been strides made on the regulatory front. In 2018, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration
(FDA) agreed to a joint regulatory framework, providing cell-based meat
with a much clearer path to market in the United States.

A more recent bill, the Food Safety Modernization for Innovative
Technologies Act, looks to formalize the agreement between FDA and USDA
to jointly regulate cell-based meat products.

This space is growing at an ever increasingly fast rate, yet there are
still real issues stunting its success, including scaling up production
and making products affordable for mass markets. And with an
ever-evolving regulatory landscape, it's difficult to keep up to date on
what is happening in the field.

Join this Summit to find the answers on your questions from scale up to
food safety to labeling and more!
