Gothenburg --- Swedish company Melt&Marble, which uses precision
fermentation to produce customized fats for the plant-based sector, has
created a non-animal fat with the properties of beef fat. Since the
technology can also be used to produce other animal fats, this could be
a real game changer in sustainable food production. In connection with
this the company secured a €5 million Series Seed financing round to
scale-up production and expand the team.

Melt&Marble's precision fermentation platform enables it to create
customized fats with molecular properties mirroring those of animal
fats, allowing for ingredients that deliver the flavor, melt and
mouthfeel of real animal fat. Its ingredients will enable a major step
forward in erasing the taste gap between conventional animal-based foods
and plant-based alternatives.

"While most people accept that we must minimize our consumption of
animal-based foods, plant-based alternatives face a big hurdle," said
CEO and Co-Founder Dr. Anastasia Krivoruchko. "The plant-based fats
currently used simply do not feel, act and taste like animal-based fats.
As a result, the food does not taste as good, making it less attractive
to consumers. As far as we're aware, this is the first beef-like fat
prototype produced via precision fermentation. It is a groundbreaking
step towards making plant-based meat tastier."

Melt&Marble's technology platform was spun out from research work
conducted over the past decade by co-founders Dr. Krivoruchko, Dr.
Florian David and Professor Jens Nielsen at Chalmers University of
Technology in Sweden. The new funding round will be used to accelerate
toward commercialization by expanding R&D efforts, scaling up
production, conducting extensive application tests and expanding the
team. The company is actively recruiting bioprocess and microbial
engineers in addition to a Head of Food Science to grow its food
technology team.

The company's recent round was led by Lever VC, an early-stage venture
capital firm focused on innovative technologies and brands in the
alternative protein space, with participation from new investors Be8
Ventures and Good Startup and existing investors Nordic Foodtech VC,
PINC (Paulig Incubator) and Chalmers Ventures.

"Melt&Marble's fermentation-derived beef fat will facilitate the step
change in product quality that companies in the space have been striving
for, increasing the size of their addressable markets and accelerating
consumer uptake," says James Caffyn, Partner at Lever VC. "We have been
hugely impressed by the progress Dr. Krivoruchko and her team have made
and are excited to support them in their growth."

Tests conducted on the company's latest prototype show it displays the
gradual melting behavior of beef fat, an important property for
achieving slow flavor release and lingering juiciness. "So much is
happening in this field, and we are immensely proud to help with the
transition towards more environmentally friendly food production," added
Dr. Krivoruchko.
