*Application Period Open Through May 29; Calls on Companies of All
Stages Solving Protein Challenges from Plant-Based to Regenerative Ag to
Apply for Funding*

[Radicle Growth](http://radicle.vc/the-radicle-challenge/), an
acceleration fund, and [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.com/), a leading
agriculture company helping to improve global food security, today
announced the launch of The Radicle Protein Challenge by Syngenta.
Together, Radicle and Syngenta will identify two companies with novel
solutions to support the future of protein (which could include new or
experimental protein sources, or protein conversion technologies) that
are solving challenges spanning from plant-based ag to the regenerative
side of agriculture, to invest \$1.25m in.

Radicle and Syngenta are seeking entrepreneurs representing companies of
all stages from around the world to apply for the \$1.25 million in
investment---\$1 million for the Challenge winner and the \$250k for the
second-place winner---to accelerate the growth of their technologies.
Applications are open through May 29, 2020. The winners will not only
receive a significant investment and custom accelerator program from
Radicle Growth but will have access to Radicle and Syngenta's broad
agriculture expertise and global agtech networks to advance and promote
their technology.

"Innovative protein sources are increasingly important for a growing
population. We are excited to be collaborating with Radicle and
entrepreneurs from around the world to accelerate innovation and I am
looking forward to seeing lots of creative ideas," **said Erik Fyrwald,
CEO, Syngenta**. "Our mission at Syngenta of helping farmers to make the
best use of available resources and grow the crops we need in an
environmentally friendly and healthy way, includes providing them with
the best products, technologies and agronomic advice."

After entries close, several months of due diligence work will begin and
4-6 finalists will be identified from the pool of applicants. The
finalists will participate in a Pitch Day competition this Fall. Each
company will have the opportunity to present in front of a leading panel
of judges, including Erik Fyrwald, who will deliberate and select the
two winners.

"Recent [Gallup
data](https://news.gallup.com/poll/282779/nearly-one-four-cut-back-eating-meat.aspx) confirms
that nearly a quarter of Americans are eating less meat than ever
before. This has increased the demand for plant-based and cellular
agriculture alternatives to traditional protein sources," said **Kirk
Haney, Managing Partner of Radicle Growth. **"Many companies focused on
this space have been hard at work with plans to launch in the near-term.
Getting the product right to meet consumer demand is only half the
battle, the pricing also needs to be right. We look forward to seeing
the companies emerging in, and looking to grow, in this space and
providing them the capital they need to overcome the challenges of
growing this segment and staying ahead of consumer demands."
