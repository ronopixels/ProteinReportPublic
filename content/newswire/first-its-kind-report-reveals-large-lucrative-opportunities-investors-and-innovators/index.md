*White space analysis shows next-gen materials set to follow alternative
proteins in growth and profitability*

**November 4, 2021** -- Materials industry nonprofit think-tank [The
Material Innovation Initiative](https://www.materialinnovation.org/)
(MII) and [The Mills Fabrica](https://www.themillsfabrica.com/), an
investor and ecosystem builder in sustainable agrifood, textiles, and
fashion industry innovations, have published an analysis of the
materials industry detailing "white space" opportunities for
animal-free, sustainable leather, down, wool, silk, fur, and exotic
skins.

"Our goal is to show this nascent industry underserved technological
efforts that will make a big impact," says MII Chief Science Officer
Sydney Gladman, Ph.D. "These white spaces do not focus on a single
product or market, but instead highlight opportunities that will produce
a ripple effect across the entire next-gen materials industry and
beyond."

The Mills Fabrica notes that -- like the alternative protein industry a
decade ago -- the next-gen materials industry is replete with untapped
opportunities. Innovators and investors are now in a position to start
the next-gen material versions of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods,
reaping the rewards of future billion-dollar companies.

"We are delighted to join hands with The Material Innovation Initiative
to discuss the untapped potential of the next-gen materials. As
consumers' awareness of sustainability continues to increase, it's the
right time to keep the traction by introducing these material
innovations to the wider community," says Angus Tsang, Research and
Investment from The Mills Fabrica.

MII's co-founders, Nicole Rawling and Stephanie Downs, both came from
the world of alternative protein.

"Stephanie and I have seen this sort of industry-wide change happen
before, and today's materials industry looks very familiar to us," notes
MII CEO Nicole Rawling.

For this analysis, MII and The Mills Fabrica define white spaces as
areas with significant opportunity for focused R&D and the creation of
new technologies and companies to fulfill unmet needs across the
next-gen ecosystem.

The most significant white spaces are in materials other than leather.
Approximately two-thirds of current players are producing next-gen
leather. This leaves silk, wool, down, fur, and exotic skins with
limited innovation efforts so far, providing many profitable
opportunities, especially in fur and silk.

Other white spaces identified include:

●      Sustainable feedstock and additives (White Spaces 2,3,4).

●      Versatile end-of-life strategies (White Space 5).

●      Implementing bottom-up materials design in R&D (White Space 6).

●      Hot spots in biotech process challenges (White Space 7).

According to the United Nations, industrial animal farming is a leading
cause of many of the most pressing problems of our time. These include
climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, air and
water pollution, excessive waste, public health risks, and animal
cruelty. Given that at least two thirds of a brand's sustainability
impact can be tied to its choice of raw materials, brands will need
alternatives to current animal materials to meet sustainability goals.

There are opportunities available across the board. Dr. Amanda Parkes,
chief innovation officer at next-gen clothing company Pangaia, puts it
simply: "We need a lot of people doing some things better, rather than a
few people doing everything perfectly."

This whitespace report provides a roadmap for innovators and investors
-- as well as brands, startups, scientists, and engineers -- looking to
do well by doing good.
