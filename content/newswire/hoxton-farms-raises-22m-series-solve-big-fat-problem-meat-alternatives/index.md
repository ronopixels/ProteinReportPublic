-   London-based Hoxton Farms is growing real animal fat, without the
    animals. Cultivated fat is the missing ingredient that will
    revolutionise the way meat alternatives look, cook and taste.
-   Its \$22m Series A was led by Collaborative Fund (an early backer of
    Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat) and Fine Structure Ventures, a
    venture capital fund affiliated with FMR LLC, the parent company of
    Fidelity Investments.
-   Other participants in the round include Systemiq Capital, AgFunder,
    MCJ Collective, and previous investors Founders Fund, BACKED VC,
    Presight Capital, CPT Capital, and Sustainable Food Ventures. The
    funding will be used to build London\'s first pilot production
    facility for cultivated fat and demonstrate Hoxton Farms' novel
    bioprocess at scale.

**London UK, 20th October 2022:** [Hoxton
Farms](https://cewcomms.mxspruce.com/FXxqh2bZQfSwr3wyS/l/ueC8SotkcmblnFey8?messageId=LlQ3kDXPXkRCDLpvP&rn=&re=gInJ3buQncvBXZy5WalR3byBHQvxGblhmI&sc=false)
has announced a \$22 million Series A round to build a pilot facility
for producing cultivated fat: the missing ingredient necessary to make
meat alternatives delicious, realistic and versatile. After receiving
regulatory approval, Hoxton Farms will sell cultivated fat as a B2B
ingredient for meat alternatives.

Since raising its \$3.6m Seed round led by Founders Fund last year,
Hoxton Farms has demonstrated the power of its computational platform.
The team uses machine learning and mathematical modelling to develop
proprietary bioreactors and low-cost animal-free culture media -- the
nutrient-rich broth used to feed cells. Now that Hoxton Farms has proven
the enabling technology for its production platform, the startup is
building a 13,000 sq ft pilot facility in Shoreditch, East London, to
scale up its manufacturing capacity.

**Max Jamilly, Co-founder of Hoxton Farms, said**, "At Hoxton Farms, we
are obsessed with fat. Fat is the single most important sensory
component in all of the meat that we eat. Using cultivated fat alongside
plant proteins, we have shown that we can make products with the
juiciness and flavour that plant-based meat has been missing. We're now
building our pilot plant in central London so that we can show visitors
a new way of making the same delicious meat."

**Jamilly continued**, "Growth in the plant-based meat market has slowed
to a crawl. There is more choice than ever before but consumers miss the
delicious flavour and juicy texture of traditional meat. Dollar sales
and market share of plant-based meat stagnated in the USA in 20211 and
almost 60 percent of US consumers are reluctant to try plant-based meat
due to its taste2. Animal agriculture has a greater worldwide impact on
climate change than transport emissions and occupies 77 percent of all
agricultural land even though it supplies only 17 percent of our food3.
But meat alternatives need significant improvement before we can make a
dent in the intensive animal agriculture industry and shut down the last
factory farm on Earth. This is where Hoxton Farms comes in."

Existing "alternative proteins" underperform due to plant oils. That\'s
because coconut, sunflower, palm, and canola oil taste funky, degrade
quickly, burn easily, melt inconsistently, and aren't as healthy as they
seem. Manufacturers add flavourings and other ingredients to the label
in an attempt to make up for the deficiencies of plant oils, but this
only makes products unhealthy and unsatisfying.

To deliver on the promise of meat made in a better way, Hoxton Farms
cultivates real animal fat in bioreactors. Its customers combine fat
with plant-based protein, bringing together the best of both
cell-cultured and plant-based products. They create blended meat
alternatives that give consumers the taste, texture, and nutrition that
they expect -- and at a fairer price.

**Ed Steele, Co-founder of Hoxton Farms, said**, "Cost and scale are two
of the biggest challenges in the cellular agriculture industry, but they
aren't talked about enough. Since we started Hoxton Farms, we have been
laser-focussed on solving these problems and, thanks to our
computational approach, have made significant breakthroughs. We've also
built an incredible team, novel technology and important customer
partnerships. Collaborative Fund and Fidelity are the perfect partners
as we build our pilot plant and demonstrate our scale-out production
process."

Hoxton Farms is inviting Londoners to imagine a new kind of city farm.
Traditional methods for commercial cell culture are based on building
larger and larger bioreactors. This approach makes sense for the
pharmaceutical industry but it's no match for the vast scales and low
costs needed to produce food. Instead, Hoxton Farms has built a "scaled
out" approach using many smaller bioreactors connected through software
and automation. The team have proven that this dramatically lowers the
cost of producing commercial-scale cultivated fat. The startup's new
pilot facility will demonstrate this novel approach at significant
volumes.

**Sophie Bakalar, Partner at Collaborative Fund, added**, "At
Collaborative Fund, we've been investing in better ways to produce meat
for over a decade, including in companies like Impossible Foods and
Beyond Meat. These brands have done a phenomenal job delivering on the
protein side of the equation, but we still need a breakthrough in fat to
compete with conventional meat on taste, texture, health, and cost.
We're convinced that Hoxton Farms is the company that will deliver on
that promise."

Cultivating fat may be less challenging than cultivating muscle, but
it\'s still impossible to produce fat at global scales using existing
methods. Instead, Hoxton Farms uses cutting-edge computational biology
and Bayesian optimisation to reduce costs, accelerate timelines, and
produce a customised product unimaginable even a few years ago.

**Jennifer Uhrig, Partner at Fine Structure Ventures, commented**, "We
are extremely impressed with the technology that Hoxton Farms has
developed. Combining machine learning, biology and engineering has
uncovered hidden insights that dramatically improve performance
throughout every stage of the production process. The proprietary
scale-out approach also removes the risk of scaling beyond pilot and
reduces the cost of producing cultivated fat. We are very excited to
work closely with the Hoxton Farms team over the next few years."

In addition to building its pilot facility, the Series A will enable
Hoxton Farms to submit regulatory dossiers, further develop its customer
partnerships to demonstrate its cultivated fat in products and improve
the cost of growing cultivated fat at scale. Currently a team of over
20, they expect to reach 50 by the end of 2023.Â 

Hoxton Farms is hiring for roles across Cell Biology, Computational
Biology, Food Science and Bioprocessing.
