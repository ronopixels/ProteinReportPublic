("Eat Beyond" or the "Company"), an investment issuer focused on the
global plant-based and alternative food sector, is announcing that its
portfolio company, Nabati Foods Inc. ("Nabati"), launched its
plant-based meat line this month on November 3, and the products are
expected to be in stores by January of 2021.

This plant-based meat line is also planned to launch in the U.S. in Q1
of 2021, in time for category resets in retail stores that take place in
March and April.

"Our Nabati burger is very different than a lot of what we are seeing on
the market today," said Ahmad Yeyah, CEO of Nabati. "We are developing a
plant-based chicken burger instead of a red meat burger, and it is also
unbreaded. This differentiates our product from what is in the market
and ultimately improves the experience that the customer has with the
product - because they have the freedom to choose how they want to enjoy
it - with or without breading. We also provide recipes if the customer
wants to bread the product themselves, or they can enjoy it as-is to
save on calories. This all contributes to creating the best possible
experience for those who enjoy our products. We have also added a
plant-based fish burger to this line, which is also not something you
typically see."

Nabati is a private food technology company that offers healthy,
plant-based products. Nabati is based in Edmonton, Alberta, and serves
the North American Market. All products are certified gluten-free,
dairy-free, egg-free, refined sugar-free, all natural (non-GMO),
certified kosher, and certified vegan.

"My wife and I started the company in 2014, two years after we moved to
Alberta, after deciding that we were simply not satisfied with the
variety of plant-based foods available in store - especially desserts,"
added Yehya. "We then began developing our own recipes at home, and
sharing them with friends and family, and eventually we took them to the
farmer's market, where the products were very well received. We started
this business with \$33,000 and now we have our products in stores
across North America."

Demand for the products has been growing steadily, and sales grew
organically by over 33% in Canada in just the past year, largely from
Nabati's dairy-free cheesecakes and Nabati Cheeze Shreds. Nabati's
dairy-free cheesecakes have just begun selling in the U.S. this fall,
and 2021 will see Nabati expanding its production facility as well as
its popular Nabati Cheeze line, introducing cheese slices. Demand for
the cheese products has been enormous and the company plans to not only
expand distribution across the U.S. but also throughout Asia and Europe
in 2022.

"The company has grown up to this point almost completely organically by
word of mouth," said Patrick Morris, CEO of Eat Beyond. "We are thrilled
to partner with Nabati to further drive this growth, expand the
company's market share and grow its product lines to serve this rapidly
expanding market not just in North America, but also across the globe.
Nabati plans to diversify its revenue sources through new products and
distribution and quickly reach its (conservative) revenue target of \$7M
by 2023."
