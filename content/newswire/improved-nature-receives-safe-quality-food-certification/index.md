GARNER, N.C. -- May 19, 2020----[Improved
Nature](https://improvednature.com/), a plant-based protein company, is
proud to share that it has earned the Safe Quality Food Certification
for its Nature's PRIME™ products. The SQF Certification is a food
quality and safety program that is globally recognized in the food
industry. The SQF food safety and quality codes are designed to meet
industry, consumer, and regulatory requirements for all sectors of the
food supply chain.

Improved Nature is honored to receive this certification as it signifies
that its products can be sold worldwide and guarantees consumers that
every Nature's PRIME™ product purchased meets the top standards for food
quality and safety. Its manufacturing facility is also certified Kosher
and Halal.

This milestone is especially significant right now as food safety has
been one of the top consumer concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.
According to the SQF Institute, while it's highly unlikely to contract
COVID-19 from food or food packaging, now more than ever it is important
for the food industry to have Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS)
based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles
in place to manage food safety risks and prevent food contamination.

"Earning the SQF Certification is a direct result of our team's hard
work to ensure we're safely producing superior food for consumers, which
we know is of utmost importance during a time like this," said President
and CEO of Improved Nature, Dr. Rody Hawkins. "The certification process
involves all aspects of food safety and security, beginning with our
ingredient suppliers all the way to our customers. We closely monitor
our plant proteins through SQF, Kosher, and Halal certifications to
ensure that we are delivering the highest quality sustainable protein
available on the market today."

With poultry and beef shortages occurring nationwide due to the
pandemic, Nielsen reported that meat alternative sales as a result
increased 255% in the last week of March. Due to the increased demand
for protein during the pandemic, Improved Nature has made its Nature's
PRIME™ products
available [online](https://improvednaturedirect.com/) for consumers and
is offering free shipping in the U.S. for orders over \$15.

Furthermore, a representative at Good Food Institute said that
plant-based meat alternatives provide not only a great increase in food
safety, but also in environmental sustainability. According to the
United Nations, truly sustainable foods include the consideration of how
the food is produced and its quality. Plant protein is a more efficient
and scalable source of food for the growing global population. All
Improved Nature proteins are sustainably sourced and provide healthy
nutrition with no artificial ingredients.

Improved Nature is committed to providing Better Protein for a Better
Planet™.
