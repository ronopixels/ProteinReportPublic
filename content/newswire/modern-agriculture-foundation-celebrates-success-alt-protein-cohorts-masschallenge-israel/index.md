(MODIIN, Israel) -- The Modern Agriculture Foundation, an Israeli
non-profit which promotes entrepreneurship and innovation in the
alternative protein industry in Israel and globally, celebrates the
sweeping success of its Better Plate alternative protein track within
MassChallenge Israel's 2022 Accelerator program.

Early-stage Israeli startups PoLoPo, which pioneered a game-changing
method to grow egg protein from plants, and AlgaHealth, which addresses
food production and nutritional challenges through the revolutionary use
of microalgae, were the two Better Plate cohorts selected to participate
in a MassChallenge roadshow to New York and Boston, granting them
audiences with major investors, officials and business leaders.

"The outsized success of Better Plate cohorts reflects the tremendous
potential of AgriFoodTech in general, and alternative proteins in
particular, to mitigate major global challenges including global food
security, environmental crises and supply chain issues," said Levana
Shifman, executive director of the Modern Agriculture Foundation. Better
Plate cohorts represent just five out of 42 total MC Israel cohorts (or
12 percent), and yet they snagged two of 10 (20 percent) of the coveted
spots in the upcoming roadshow.

"MassChallenge Israel is laser focused on creating positive impact and
is committed to further developing our vibrant innovation ecosystem,"
remarked Aaron Zucker, executive director of MC Israel. "Alternative
protein innovation has far-reaching implications for our planet and
humanity, and impact investors are increasingly cognizant of that fact."

In its first year, the Better Plate track is the only accelerator in the
Middle East specifically tailored to the needs of high-impact
alternative protein startups.

"Better Plate engaged phenomenal mentors and experts," said Eran
Itzkovitch, CEO of AlgaHealth, who received his award from MAF's
Shifman. "Working closely with such a strong group brought us one big
step closer to a better, healthier world."

"We couldn't have asked for a more excellent program. We were privileged
to be part of the 2022 cohort, among so many amazing startups,"
emphasized PoLoPo co-founders Maya Sapir-Mir and Raya Liberman Aloni,
who accepted their award from MC Israel's Zucker along with his
predecessor Yonit Serkin.

Hundreds convened at Jerusalem's Shalem College July 20 for the
announcement of the roadshow winners at the celebratory culmination of
the accelerator, which included warm greetings from Mayor Moshe Leon.

"MAF is deeply grateful to its indispensable partners for their
invaluable support, ensuring the track's success and enabling our
promising startups to soar," remarked Shifman, praising InNegev, a
unique technology incubator in Israel's Negev region; Reinhold Cohn
Group, a leading Israeli patent firm; Proveg International and Animal
Charity Evaluators.

*The Modern Agriculture Foundation is an Israeli non-profit which
promotes innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercial scale
manufacturing in the young and thriving field of alternative proteins.
By nurturing early-stage startups developing transformational
substitutes for traditional meat, dairy, and egg products, MAF supports
innovation solutions to create a more sustainable, kinder food system
equipped to meet the nutritional needs of the world's growing population
even as water and land resources are diminishing.*
