*Ability to Replicate Lactoferrin, a Key Nutrient for Development and
Growth of Nursing Infants, A Major Step Forward in Mission to Provide
Authentic Cell-Cultured Breast Milk Components to Formula Producers*

REHOVOT, Israel -- June 13, 2022
-- [Wilk](https://wilkismilk.com/) (TASE: WILK), a developer of
authentic, cell-based human and animal milk and milk components, today
announced it was able to successfully produce the breast milk protein,
lactoferrin, in internal testing in its laboratories. This makes Wilk
one of the first bio-FoodTech companies to advance the production of
cell-cultured human milk.

Lactoferrin, a key protein in human breast milk, can be found in
concentrations [up to 50 times higher than bovine
milk](https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fulltext/2011/12000/Bovine_Lactoferrin_Can_Be_Taken_Up_by_the_Human.8.aspx),
is the major protein responsible for providing iron and other key
nutrients to nursing infants and is essential to supporting the growth
and development of newborns. Incorporating human lactoferrin proteins
into infant formula can result in a product that is considerably closer
to real breast milk than the cow and plant-based substitutes currently
available on the market.

"This breakthrough brings us one step closer to our goal of providing
all infants with the full range of nutritional benefits that can only be
found in breast milk," said Tomer Aizen CEO of Wilk. "This is
significant news for both the infant formula industry and parents who
may soon have access to the optimal product for ensuring their infants'
growth and development."

In addition to its benefits for infant nutrition, lactoferrin has
displayed significant potential in addressing a range of other health
issues, with studies showing its preventive and therapeutic benefits for
conditions including coronary heart disease and even
[coronavirus](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01221/full#:~:text=10.3389%2Ffimmu.2020.01221-,The%20Biology%20of%20Lactoferrin%2C%20an%20Iron%2DBinding%20Protein%20That%20Can,Defend%20Against%20Viruses%20and%20Bacteria&text=Lactoferrin%20is%20a%20nutrient%20classically,%2C%20bile%2C%20and%20cerebrospinal%20fluid.).
Recent trials have also reported that lactoferrin can bind to some of
the receptors through which the coronavirus attacks cells in the
digestive and respiratory system, thus potentially preventing infection.

Wilk estimates that further development will enable the production of
human lactoferrin in unlimited amounts, thus facilitating the long-term
sustainable production of such proteins independent of animal or
human sources.

**About Wilk ** 

Wilk operates at the crossroads of Biotech and FoodTech, developing
technologies for producing cultured human breast and animal milk. Having
launched operations in 2020, the company holds patents on laboratory
production processes that replicate the milk-producing cells of humans
and other mammals to create 100% real milk and milk components in
laboratory settings. Wilk (formerly BioMilk) is publicly traded on the
Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "WILK."
