*Collaboration accelerates plans to commercialize cellular aquaculture
globally**** ***

San Diego, Calif. (January 16, 2020) -- BlueNalu, a leading innovative
food company developing seafood products directly from fish cells, today
announced a strategic partnership with Nutreco, a global leader in
animal nutrition and aquafeed. Nutreco's aquafeed company, Skretting, is
a world leader in the manufacture and supply of aquaculture feeds and an
important link in the feed-to-food chain. 

The two companies have formalized a partnership agreement, that builds
upon BlueNalu's platform technology for production of cell-based seafood
products from a wide variety of species.  This is intended to create a
more stable and sustainable supply-chain solution as the global demand
for seafood is continually increasing. Nutreco brings a breadth of
knowledge and deep expertise to the partnership, including fish
nutrition, raw materials expertise and ingredient procurement at
competitive costs. Both companies' technologies are well aligned to
advance sustainable solutions to feed the world.  

Lou Cooperhouse, President & CEO of BlueNalu, said, "The partnership
with Nutreco is another significant milestone for BlueNalu, which will
enable our team to accelerate our journey toward commercialization,
while also securing a global supply chain partner.  We expect this will
provide significant value to our company, as it is our objective to
introduce our seafood products in a test market during the next two
years, and launch our products in several global markets by the end of
this decade." 

The demand for protein, including seafood, will increase as the global
population is expected to rise to almost 10 billion by 2050. Innovations
and technologies, such as cell-based seafood, may be required to help to
meet this demand in a sustainable manner. BlueNalu offers a third option
that complements wild-caught and farm-raised seafood that benefits human
health, encourages responsible food consumption and promotes
food security.

Rob Koremans, Nutreco CEO, says, "Since the global demand for protein is
increasing, we need to provide protein from a variety of sources,
including traditional aquaculture farming as well as new innovative
solutions. Nutreco's strategic partnership with BlueNalu is very
exciting as it opens the opportunity to up-scale real seafood production
in a highly sustainable way."
