**Lever VC announces first close of Lever VC Fund I; Fund has US\$23
million in committed capital and a portfolio of ten trailblazing
startups across the U.S., Europe and Asia**

**New York** --- Lever VC, a global alternative protein venture capital
fund whose partners were investors in Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods,
Memphis Meats and other sector leaders, announced today it recently
completed the first close of Lever VC Fund I. The Fund, which is
investing globally in early stage plant-based and cell-cultivated meat
and dairy companies, has already amassed a portfolio of ten trailblazing
alternative protein startups around the world. The Fund currently has
\$23 million USD in capital commitments.

"The alternative protein market is continuing to grow quickly, and with
our deep experience and proven record of returns in the sector, as well
as preeminent deal flow across the North America, Europe, Asia and
beyond, Lever VC is perfectly positioned to deliver value to investors
looking for financial or strategic exposure to alternative protein" said
Lawrence Chu, Lever VC Partner and founder of Lever VC GP Venture Smart
Financial Holdings Limited. Lever VC has staff and venture partners in
the U.S., U.K., France, Israel, India, Hong Kong, mainland China, and
Singapore.

The Lever VC Fund I portfolio includes TurtleTree Labs, the first
company in the world producing cow's milk and human breast milk from
cell cultivation; Better Meat Co, whose plant-based meat protein blend
is featured in Perdue Farms products at over 7,000 grocery stores across
the U.S.; Good Planet Foods, a top plant-based cheese player with
distribution at Walmart, Albertsons, Kroger, Costco, White Castle and
elsewhere; Mission Barns, whose cell-cultivated bacon products are
currently available at select restaurants in San Francisco; The Good
Spoon, a fast-growing plant-based condiments brand with distribution at
top European retailers; and Bond Pet Foods, the first company in the
world producing real meat protein from fermentation. Lever VC leverages
its own proprietary database to track over 1,200 alternative protein
companies globally.

Lever VC Managing Partner Nick Cooney and Partner Lawrence Chu have been
investing in the alternative protein sector since 2015, and were
investors in Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, Memphis Meats, JUST, Aleph
Farms, Kite Hill and other leading plant-based and cultivated meat and
dairy companies. Lawrence Chu has also deployed over \$450 million USD
in private equity investments in conventional animal protein companies.
Nick Cooney co-founded the Good Food Institute, the world's largest
alternative protein industry NGO, and has worked with major food groups
in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia for 15 years.

"We decided to invest in alternative protein in 2018, and started
approaching a few VCs," said Benny Pei, Lever VC Partner and Chief
Investment Officer of Lever VC GP DFP Capital. "We were most impressed
with the Lever VC founders' long investment experience and track record
in this exciting field, so we joined them to start strategically
deploying assets in this fast-growing global sector."

Lever VC will continue to identify investment opportunities in early
stage alternative protein companies, and remains open to additional
investors until reaching final close. The Fund is confident the
alternative protein sector will continue to grow quickly due to
increasing consumer interest in health, food safety and sustainability,
and Lever VC is uniquely positioned to capture the enormous
opportunities ahead.
