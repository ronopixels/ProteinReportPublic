PORTLAND, Ore.---Feb. 8, 2021---Plant-based dairy startup [Take Two
Foods](https://www.taketwofoods.com/), which launched the world's first
barleymilk in March of 2020, is excited to announce expansion into
several new grocery markets this year, including **Sprouts Farmers
Market**, **Imperfect Foods**, **New Seasons Market**, and **New Leaf
Community Markets**. The company has also brought on seven new key
members to its rapidly growing team in the last six months.

**Market Expansion**\
Take Two Foods' flagship product, Take Two Barleymilk, is currently sold
in **Whole Foods Market** and **Market of Choice** throughout the
Pacific Northwest and is expanding quickly into Northern California and
Southern California, as well as select retailers in the Midwest and
Northeast. Via the direct-to-consumer channel, Take Two has announced a
March launch with **Imperfect Foods**, a grocery delivery service that
works to eliminate food waste and build a better food system for
everyone, directly aligning with Take Two Foods' values.

Take Two Foods has signed on with **Sprouts Farmers Market**, a
supermarket chain based in Arizona that offers a wide selection of
natural and organic [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food)
foods; Take Two Barleymilk will be featured in Sprouts' 340 stores in 23
states. The company has also signed on with **New Seasons Market** and
will be featured in all of its stores---18 in the Portland Metropolitan
area and one in Northern California. Take Two Foods is also going to be
available in all five **New Leaf Community Markets** in Northern
California.

"We're so excited to be experiencing such extensive growth in key
markets," said **Sarah Pool, Take Two Foods Co-Founder and CEO**. "Our
planet and its sustained health are of primary importance to people
across the U.S. We look forward to bringing this important nutrition to
people everywhere, collectively contributing to a more sustainable food
system and better future.\"

Take Two\'s products are crafted from rejuvenated barley, upcycled grain
that is high in protein and other essential nutrients. Healthy fats from
organic high oleic sunflower oil and coconut cream, blended with the
barley and pea protein, delivers all nine essential amino acids and five
to eight grams of complete protein per serving. Calcium, potassium, and
vitamin D are added to make a wholesome vegan milk alternative that
provides 50% more calcium than dairy milk and at least 50% less sugar
than other flavored milks. Take Two Barleymilk comes in four flavors:
Chef's Blend, Unsweetened, Chocolate, and Vanilla.

**Team Growth**\
In the past six months, Take Two Foods has brought on seven key team
members with a diverse set of skills and talents to help nourish the
world through the transformative power of circularity. The company is
pleased to announce **Sujit Srinivas** as its new VP of Operations and
Supply Chain. Srinivas is a plant-based food advocate who enjoys leading
companies in their journey towards sustainable and profitable growth by
designing, implementing, and executing an efficient operations and
supply chain strategy. He currently also mentors early-stage companies
that are part of the Built Oregon network and serves as an advisor to
The Bitter Housewife. He previously worked at Craft Brew Alliance and
Intel.

The company has also welcomed **Rich Matusow** as Chief Sales Officer.
Matusow is a natural products industry veteran with over 20 years of
experience devising and implementing strategic growth plans for
mission-driven companies. He spent 10 years with Sambazon, as an equity
partner and as its VP of Business Development where he focused on
developing new sales channels and teams to optimize both the growth of
Sambazon in the USA and to help drive the market-driven conservation
model in the Amazon.

**Luke Mafazy** has come on board as CFO, bringing with him over 10
years of consumer packaged goods experience. Prior to joining the team,
Mafazy attended London Business School to gain a more global perspective
on business. Post grad school, he joined ABInBev in its Global MBA
program, living in Belgium, Switzerland, and the U.S.

Other new additions include **Melissa Fears** as Marketing and Brand
Manager, responsible for heading up the strategy and execution of all
omni-channel marketing, creative and field marketing; **Sara Hewitt** as
Sales Director; **Mitch Thisius**, RDN, as product developer; and
**Jacob Trinchero** as Warehouse Lead. The new Take Two team members
join Pool; **Matt Olsofsky**, co-founder and COO; and **Breyn Hibbs**,
Head of Sustainability, Impact, and Partnerships. Take Two Foods is
headquartered in Portland, Oregon.

Take Two Foods is working on expanding into shelf-stable packaging later

to develop adjacent plant-based dairy products such as coffee creamer,
ice cream, yogurt, and cheese.
