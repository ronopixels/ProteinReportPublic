*The New, known for its top-quality and better-for-you plant based meat
and ready-meal lines, taps meat industry veteran for next stage of
growth*

**Sao Paulo** ---Brazilian plant-based meat brand The New announced
today it has appointed as CEO André Carvalho, Country Sales and
Marketing Director for top 20 global meat company Minerva Foods. At
Minerva, Carvalho managed U\$1bn of revenue and a team of 400 that
covered more than 48,000 customers monthly, and created one of the
largest protein B2B e-commerce platforms in Brazil. Prior to Minerva,
Carvalho held senior positions at Bunge, PepsiCo, and Associated British
Foods subsidiary AB Brasil. The appointment comes following strong 20%
quarter-over-quarter sales growth for The New in Q1, and the launch of a
popular new plant-based pork line in Q2 of this year.

"I am very excited to have joined The New team. It has the highest
quality products in Brazil and an excellent brand, which together
position it to capitalize on the rapidly expanding alternative protein
market," said Carvalho. "The company-owned manufacturing and R&D
facilities and fantastic innovation pipeline position The New for
continued strong growth in the coming years."

"We are very excited for André to join the team and confident that he
has the experience to grow the company to the next level," added The New
Founder Bruno Fonseca, who will continue to head R&D and new product
development as well as serve on the company's board of directors.

As part of the expansion into additional channels The New has also hired
as head of sales Gustavo Cria, former Indirect Channel Leader for
plant-based brand NotCo. The New has established relationships with
major retail chains including Carrefour, Pao de Açucar and Oba, and is
building its portfolio of specialist restaurant chains, aided by its
superior health profile and premium quality. The broad portfolio across
plant-based meat and fish products is set to expand with the development
of a ready meal range delivering premium convenience products to
consumers.

"André's extensive experience in successfully driving sales expansion
for top packaged goods, food service and meat brands is a great addition
for The New as it continues to grow the reach of its premium quality
alternative plant-based meats," said James Caffyn, Partner at venture
capital fund Lever VC and Board Chair of The New. "We believe his strong
leadership experience will further fuel the next chapter of growth for
the company, and we are excited to have him on board." Lever VC is a
global venture capital fund specialized in the alternative protein
sector, whose partners were early investors in other leading brands
including Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.
