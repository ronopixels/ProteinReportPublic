(PALO ALTO, CA - May 17, 2022) -- The Australian Commonwealth Government
today announced Change Foods will be a key industry partner in the
University of Queensland and Queensland University of Technology's (QUT)
\$164 million (AUD) Trailblazer Universities Food and Beverage
Accelerator (FaBA). The multi-million dollar grant will be used to
commercialize sustainable animal-free dairy ingredients and products
made with precision fermentation technology.

Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, [Change
Foods](http://changefoods.com/) is an US-Australian food tech company
originally founded in Australia by David Bucca and Professor Junior
Te'o.  The company has research laboratories and teams on both
continents.

The grant accelerates an ongoing research collaboration between Change
Foods and QUT, leveraging the University's facilities in Brisbane and
the new Queensland Government supported QUT Mackay Renewable
Bio-commodities Pilot Plant. Over the last two years Change Foods has
collaborated with QUT to pioneer the production of animal-free dairy,
employing microbes in place of cows to produce real milk proteins. QUT
Professor of Microbial Biotechnology, Robert Speight said, "QUT has the
infrastructure and research expertise to support research in this area
and accelerate the growth of precision fermentation industry partners
such as Change Foods."

On May 5, 2022 Change Foods announced a similar \$1 million grant by the
Commonwealth Government to work with QUT as part of the Securing Raw
Materials Program designed to transform sugarcane products into valuable
feedstocks for precision fermentation.  "These two grants recognize the
quality of our team and the progress we have achieved in a short space
of time. Our ongoing FaBA research collaboration with QUT will further
hasten our goal to bring animal-free dairy products to market in the
near future," said David Bucca, Founder and CEO of Change Foods.

Tom Davies, Vice President of Research and Operations (APAC) for Change
Foods said, "we are excited the Commonwealth Government has recognized
that Queensland - with its world-leading capabilities and teams of
micro-biologist researchers - is uniquely positioned to help drive
growth in synthetic biology and future food manufacturing. We look
forward to working with State and Federal Governments to help Australia
support this nascent industry and secure our share of this \$700 billion
global business."

QUT and Change Foods are among a consortium of 18 research, industry and
commercialization partners in the FaBA, a UQ-led food and beverage
accelerator focused on alternative food manufacturing.
