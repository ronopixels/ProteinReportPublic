*Proprietary approach brews chicken protein through biotechnology and
fermentation, instead of harvesting conventionally on farm and field*

**BOULDER, COLORADO --**  [Bond Pet Foods, Inc.](https://bondpets.com/),
the Boulder-based company working with biotechnology to make animal-free
and protein-rich pet food, today announced the creation of the world's
first animal-free, cultured chicken meat protein for pet food
applications. The prototype is a big step on its way to scale-up and
commercialize production.

Using a proprietary production process that is more humane and
sustainable compared with conventional agriculture, Bond is able to take
a harmless, one-time blood sample - in this case, from a heritage hen
named Inga who is alive and well at a farm in Lindsborg, Kansas - to
determine the genetic code for the best types of chicken proteins to
nourish dogs and cats.

The genetic code is then coupled with a strain of food grade yeast. When
this yeast is grown in a fermentation tank, it churns out meat proteins
that are identical to those typically produced on farm and field. It\'s
a similar fermentation process that's been used for half a century to
make enzymes for cheese, but Bond is reassembling the process to harvest
high quality animal proteins.

To demonstrate the cultured chicken protein's cooking potential as well
as its palatability with dogs, Bond enlisted its food science and
nutrition teams to develop a baked treat recipe with the novel
ingredient, and then fed samples to a select group of lucky dogs at the
company's Boulder headquarters. The exercise showed promise on both
fronts, with high mixability and enthusiastic uptake from dog
volunteers. More robust feeding trials, including detailed analysis of
palatability and digestibility, will be performed in the future.

Bond's cultured chicken protein, once fully developed, will have the
same primary nutrients of conventional chicken meat including its
essential amino acids, and will meet or exceed AAFCO requirements for
both dogs and cats. Its first chicken-based products will debut in 2023.

"Our initial tests with dog volunteers have been very promising, and its
nutritionals, palatability and digestibility will only improve on our
path to commercialization," said Pernilla Audibert, Co-Founder and CTO
of Bond Pet Foods. "The science team at Bond is also working on
production of other cultured meat proteins made through a similar
fermentation process. The successful chicken prototype is a
demonstration of our technology's potential to create a complete
portfolio of animal proteins for pet consumption, and beyond."

"A new wave of responsible food production is emerging, working with the
best that nature and science has to offer, and our team is leading this
wave in Pet." said Rich Kelleman, Co-Founder and CEO of Bond Pet Foods.
"Our team's continued developments are laying the foundation to bring
high-value meat protein and nutrition to dogs and cats, while removing
farm animals from the equation."

With this milestone, Bond has also closed a bridge round of funding to
accelerate its work, with follow-on from seed investors Lever VC and KBW
Ventures, and new funds Stage 1 and Trellis Road participating.

Bond's first consumer product launched last May - its [Protein-Packed
Dog Treat
Bar](https://bondpets.com/get-treats/protein-packed-dog-treat-bar/) made
with a pure nutritional yeast. While not animal derived, the yeast
protein in the recipe is made through a similar fermentation technique
and provides high quality supplemental nutrition.
