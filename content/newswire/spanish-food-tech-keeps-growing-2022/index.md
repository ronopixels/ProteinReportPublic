**Madrid, December 21st ---** [Eatable
Adventures](https://eatableadventures.com/), one of the world\'s leading
agri-food accelerators, has presented the data from its annual study
**\"The State of Foodtech in Spain 2022,\"** a report gathering key
information on the characterization and investment evolution of the
Spanish food-tech entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Broadly, 2022 has been a positive year for the sector in the country.
Despite the macroeconomic context, the Spanish startups have been
supported by investors, companies and governments, which have taken a
much more active role in the growth of the Spanish ecosystem.

In 2022, Spain remains in the global top 10 ranking in terms of number
of food-tech startups, whose latest census, according to the report,
totals **412 startups**. As for the key areas of the food-tech sector,
once again this year, 4 major categories were identified, showing a
fairly balance among them: **Agritech (24%); Food Production and
Transformation (34%); Logistics, Distribution and Retail (25%); and
Restaurant Tech (16%).**

Spanish startups are solvent at a technological level and have a solid
level of development. The percentage of startups that decide **to patent
their solutions or generate utility models is growing**: 32,9% of
startups have patents, 56,6% have a trademark registration and 29% have
a trade secret. There is significant growth in the use of artificial
intelligence, with an increase of more than 12 points, compared to last
year, as well as in machine learning and IoT, with an increase of 8,5
and 9,6 points, respectively. Regarding the degree of technological
development (TRL) of the startups, more than 80% have market-ready
solutions and 14% are still at an intermediate stage.

This year, **the total investment figure stands at 268 million euros**,
an increase of 9,38% compared to the previous year, not considering the
investment round achieved by Glovo (450 million euros). In addition,
**the increase in Series A rounds stands out, growing by nearly 20%**, 5
points more than in 2021.

The largest investments have been in startups working in
foodservice/retail, but the emergence of the protein alternative stands
out among investments. The top 5 startups leading this ranking are
**Cover Manager (€52M), Heura (€20M), Good News (€11M), Nova Meat (€6M)
and Cubiq (€6M).**

"*Spain is consolidating its position as a food-tech nation with a
flourishing ecosystem and great technological and intellectual solvency,
which has attracted the interest of global investors and corporates
throughout the year. Proof of this are the investment rounds received by
some of the startups of our Spain food-tech portfolio, such as Cocuus,
Innomy or Moa Foodtech,"* commented José Luis Cabañero, CEO and founder
at Eatable Adventures.

**New Call for projects for Spain food tech, the national food tech
acceleration program**

projects for the acceleration program Spain Foodtech Startups\' Program.
