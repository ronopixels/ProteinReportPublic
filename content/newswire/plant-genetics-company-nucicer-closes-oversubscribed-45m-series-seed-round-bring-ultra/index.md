**Davis, CA, March 2, 2022** - NuCicer, Inc., a crop genetics company
pioneering ultra-high protein varieties of chickpea, today announced the
closing of a \$4.5 million Series Seed financing round. Lever VC, an
early-stage venture capital firm focused on innovative technologies and
brands in the alternative protein space, led NuCicer's round. Other
participants included The House Fund, a fund backed by the University of
California Endowment, as well as Trellis Road and Lifely VC.

The company has developed non-GM, proprietary chickpeas with up to 75%
higher protein content than commodity chickpeas. The new funding will
support commercialization trials of NuCicer's first generation
varieties, as well as the scaling of NuCicer's genomic-guided speed
breeding program to provide continuous product development and bring
further novel improvements to market.

"We are excited by the overwhelming interest we received from the
investment community in our Series Seed round and are now focused on
moving forward with partnerships and commercialization," said Kathryn
Cook, CEO and co-founder of NuCicer. "We aim to cut the cost of chickpea
protein nearly in half, making it price-competitive with other plant
proteins such as soy and pea. This creates opportunities for our
partners to develop new food and beverage products using our highly
functional chickpea flour and purified protein ingredients."

"With its excellent nutritionals, neutral flavor and color, and positive
consumer perception, chickpea protein is an ideal ingredient for
plant-based foods but has been too expensive to date," said Nick Cooney,
Managing Partner of Lever VC. "NuCicer will be able to bring to market
chickpea protein ingredients, high-protein flours and whole beans with
an incredible competitive advantage in pricing and functionality. We are
truly excited about what Kathryn and the NuCicer team have created and
are pleased to support them in their growth."

NuCicer is focused on making high-value chickpea ingredients affordable
to support human nutrition and improve the sustainability of global food
systems -- both by supporting the shift from animal to plant-based foods
as well as opening opportunities for improvement at every step of the
value chain.
