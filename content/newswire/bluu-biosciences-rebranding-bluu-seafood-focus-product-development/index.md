**Berlin, March 1st, 2022.** Bluu Biosciences, pioneer in the
development and production of cultivated fish in Europe, is rebranding
into Bluu Seafood with the new name reflecting the change from a
predominantly research-oriented biotech to a more product-focused
foodtech. Bluu Seafood will be introducing its first product based on
cultivated fish and plant components in the second half of this year.
Full market launch will depend on the regulatory requirements in the
respective target markets and is most likely going to take place
initially in Asia, the UK, or the US, before EU-approval will be
granted.

Research and development remain important to produce cultivated fish
products on a relevant scale. However, with process optimization already
achieved, Bluu Seafood is now focusing on the development of
market-ready cultured fish products that no longer differ in taste,
texture and cooking behaviour from comparable products based on
wild-caught or aqua cultured fish.

Dr Sebastian Rakers, founder and managing director of Bluu Seafood
explained: \"As a company, we are continuously growing and evolving.
Changing the brand name to Bluu Seafood reflects this evolution. We are
growing organically, mastering the processes, and are now focusing
increasingly on product development and go-to-market.\"

Heavy fishing and marine pollution are threatening fish stocks
worldwide. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
estimates that more than 90 percent of the world\'s fish stocks are
either overfished (33.1%) or fished to maximum sustainable levels
(59.9%). Therefore, sustainable alternatives are needed to ensure a
long-term supply of animal protein for the world\'s population. Bluu
Seafood is working to create one of those alternatives with cultured
fish that is delicious, healthy, and sustainable.

\"We believe that cultivated fish will be an important alternative
source of protein to feed the world\'s growing population in the future,
and Bluu Seafood is well positioned to tackle the upcoming scaling
process,\" emphasized Dr Christian Dammann, Chief Operating Officer of
the company. \"Fish and fish products are traded and consumed
internationally, so from our perspective it makes sense to start with a
brand name that is widely understood and immediately tells consumers
what it is all about.\"

**About Bluu GmbH (Bluu Seafood)**

Bluu Seafood (previously Bluu Biosciences) is the first company in
Europe to specialize in the development and commercial production of
cultivated fish. As a pioneer at the interface of biotechnology and food
technology, Bluu Biosciences is stepping up to produce high-quality,
sustainable fish products from cell cultures, that feature high
nutritional value and a premium flavour profile. The aim is to produce

by Dr Sebastian Rakers and Simon Fabich with an expert team of marine
biologists, cell biologists, tissue engineers, and food technologists.
