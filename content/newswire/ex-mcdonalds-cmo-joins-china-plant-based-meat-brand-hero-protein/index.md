*Shanghai-based HERO Protein adds new CEO Vicky Lee, former senior
executive at McDonald's and other leading restaurant brands*

**Shanghai** --- Plant-based meat company HERO Protein announced today
that Vicky Lee, former CMO of McDonald's Taiwan and former Group Vice
President at major restaurant brand Xiabu Xiabu, has joined as CEO to
help accelerate the company's growth. HERO Protein's plant-based chicken
and beef products, which are created with cutting edge high moisture
extrusion technology to mimic real meat texture, launched on the market
in January and have already landed at a range of top restaurants and
corporate and school dining facilities in Shanghai.

\"I am very excited to join the team at HERO Protein, where we share the
mission to create healthier and more sustainable alternatives for
Chinese consumers," said HERO Protein CEO Vicky Lee. "With growing
concerns on health, food safety and sustainability in China, I believe
the development of plant-based foods is a key part of the solution, and
we have the right technology and people at HERO Protein to bring the
best offerings to the market.\"

Lee joins HERO Protein with more than 20 years of experience in the food
industry, including 15 years at McDonald's Corporation where she last
served as CMO of McDonald's Taiwan, leading the company to ten
consecutive years of positive same-store growth. She also served as
Group Vice President of Xiabu Xiabu Catering Management (China) Holdings
Co., China's second largest hotpot restaurant chain, and Group Vice
President and General Manager at Better Me Precision Nutrition.

In addition to the appointment of Lee as CEO, HERO Protein also
announced the re-branding of its Chinese name to better emphasize its
mission and vision. The new name, 植物家, can be translated as both
"plant-based pioneer" and "plant-based powerhouse," demonstrating the
company's ambition to lead the development of the new protein industry
in China and make plant-based foods a daily staple of Chinese
households. The company, which has already received financial backing
from leading food corporates and investors in the alternative protein
space, will be opening a Seed fundraising round this month.

HERO Protein is the first domestic company in China to sell plant-based
meat products produced using high moisture extrusion. Founded in 2020
and based in Shanghai, HERO Protein has combined the formulation
expertise of R&D experts who crafted products for leading global
plant-based brands Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods with a local
leadership team that has deep expertise in the restaurant, food service
and grocery sectors in China. HERO aims to become the leading
plant-based meat brand delivering best-in-class plant-based products
formulated specifically for the Chinese market. The company was named to
the International Future Agrifood 2020 Alternative Protein Top 20 list,
and was a winner of TechNode Global's 2020 ORIGIN Innovation Awards in
the Food & AgriTech category.
