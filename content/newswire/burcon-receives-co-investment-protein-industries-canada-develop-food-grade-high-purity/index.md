**Vancouver, British Columbia, April 7, 2022** \-- Burcon NutraScience
Corporation ("Burcon or the "Company") (TSX: BU) (NASDAQ: BRCN), a
global technology leader in the development of plant-based proteins for
foods and beverages, is pleased to announce that it has received a
co-investment from Protein Industries Canada for the development of
high-quality protein ingredients from sunflower seeds.

The \$1 million project will see Burcon partnering with Pristine
Gourmet, a processor of 100% pure Canadian non-GMO cold pressed virgin
oils, to further develop Burcon's novel process for the production of
sunflower protein ingredients.  Premium sunflower protein isolate, that
contains greater than 90% protein purity and have exceptional taste and
functionality, has the potential of setting a new benchmark in the
growing plant-based ingredients market. Leveraging Burcon's core protein
extraction and purification platform, the project intends to fine-tune
and scale up an economical extraction and isolation process arising from
the by-product (pressed cake) of sunflower oil production.

"Sunflower protein checks all the boxes as an ideal source of
plant-based protein," said Peter H. Kappel, Burcon's interim CEO and
Chairman of the board, adding, "With this investment, Burcon and
Pristine Gourmet can accelerate the development of value-added premium
protein ingredients coming from a by-product normally used as animal
feed."

Protein Industries Canada's co-investment further supports Canadian
innovation in the development of cutting-edge food technologies and
patent-pending processes to develop products that are unique in the
global plant-based protein marketplace.

"Canada's plant-based food and ingredients sector has seen tremendous
growth over the past several years, thanks largely to the innovation
shown by our entrepreneurs and researchers," Protein Industries Canada
CEO Bill Greuel said. "The development of new ingredients, processing
technologies and food products is key to seeing this growth continue. As
our companies work together to bring these developments from idea to
full-scale implementation, Canadians can look forward to a strengthened
economy, new healthy and sustainable options on grocery store shelves,
and an increased ability to meet the growing global demand for
plant-based protein."

Sunflower protein ingredients are naturally non-GMO, have a favourable
taste profile, low allergenicity, are particularly label-friendly, and
easily understood and accepted by consumers.  As the world's third
largest oilseed crop, behind soy and canola, sunflower seed has
significant potential to be a major source of protein within the
plant-based food revolution.  Sunflower seed proteins produced using
Burcon's extraction technology exhibit unique and potentially valuable
functional characteristics as well as a nutritional profile similar to
that of canola protein.  Unlocking the potential of protein present in
sunflower seed for mainstream food ingredient applications could mean
that we would be unlocking vast quantities of novel plant protein
worldwide.

**About Burcon NutraScience Corporation**

Burcon is a global technology leader in the development of plant-based
proteins for foods and beverages. With over two decades of experience
formulating high-purity proteins that have superior functionality, taste
and nutrition, Burcon has amassed an extensive patent portfolio covering
its novel plant-based proteins derived from pea, canola, soy, hemp,
sunflower seed, among other plant sources. In 2019, Merit Functional
Foods Corporation (\"Merit Foods\") was established between Burcon and
three veteran food industry executives. Merit Foods has since built and
commissioned a state-of-the-art protein production facility in Manitoba,
Canada that is producing, under license from Burcon, best-in-class pea
and canola proteins for the food and beverage industries. For more
