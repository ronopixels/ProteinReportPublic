**Gothenburg, January 4, 2023** --- Gothenburg-based food-tech company
Mycorena endeavours to accelerate a new category of hybrid meat products
alongside Swedish food industry actors Nybergs Deli and ICA. The
initiative aims to enable a shift toward more sustainable consumption by
introducing blended products of meat and mycoprotein.

Recent years have shown an increasing demand for more sustainable and
healthy alternatives to meat as consumers become more conscious of
nutritional aspects and climate impact. Meat is still dominating the
protein market, but actors in the food chain now crave a transformation
in the system. As meat production alone is responsible for roughly
15%[\[1\]](#_ftn1) of all greenhouse gas emissions, producers are
beginning to acknowledge the need for diversification for more
sustainable production.

While plant-based options are more sustainable, recent studies and
debates have found them to have some disadvantages regarding nutritional
value and uptake. And, so far, plant-based products have yet to meet
consumer expectations to the extent that it creates a shift in the
market. Even hybrid products mixing plant-based protein and meat have
not proven successful. To enable change in consumer behaviour, Mycorena
strives to introduce hybrid products adapted to consumer needs.

Mixing meat with more qualitative, nutritious, and sustainable options,
such as mycoprotein, ensures that the products maintain the aspects most
important to consumers. Initial product validation tests have found that
consumers hold health and nutrition equally important to sustainability.
Hybrid products could reduce consumers' meat consumption significantly
while providing sufficient nutrients and still enjoying the qualities of
meat.

*'We need to change how we produce food and reduce meat consumption.
However, for everyone to completely cut out meat is unrealistic. Going
vegetarian is a big step for many. Hybrid products could solve this
issue. By blending meat and mycoprotein, we can reduce the environmental
impact while still consciously consuming meat,*' says Sandra Zachrisson,
Head of Product Innovation at Mycorena.

Mycorena's proprietary mycoprotein ingredient Promyc is neutral in taste
and with a meat-like texture, making it an excellent option for hybrid
blends to maintain the taste and texture customers desire. Hybrids
provide a conscious choice for anyone who wants to consume less meat and
an easy option for those who struggle with it. Moreover, it provides
excellent nutritional value to ensure a balanced and healthy diet.
However, despite mycoprotein\'s advantages, the market has thus far not
utilised its potential in a hybrid segment.

Therefore, Mycorena is now developing hybrid prototypes to test mixes
and validate products on the market. Beginning with mainstream mince
products, produced together with Nybergs Deli, the mycoprotein producer
intends to initially test the market and consumer demand with ICA to
build a new category.

*'We are aware that meat is a food with an environmental impact and that
consumption accounts for a part of people's climate impact. We also
believe that total meat consumption will decrease somewhat over time.
However, there will still be a large demand for meat products on the
market. We believe that there is great potential for hybrid products for
consumers who want to continue to enjoy meat but in a slightly smaller
amount,'* says Mikael Ottestig, Commercial Manager at Nybergs Deli.

By taking on a more consumer-oriented approach, the initiative strives
to provide options to families struggling to find alternatives that
combine simple and nutritious with conscious and children-friendly. The
goal is to reduce food security gaps and make it more accessible to eat
healthily and sustainably. Therefore, hybrid products must be affordable
and competitively priced to enable consumers to take the step.

*"We see potential in developing hybrid products in the meat and
charcuterie category that facilitates consumers to make more healthy and
sustainable choices from the shelf. It is supposed to be easy to choose
even more nutritious everyday favourites at ICA,"* says Peder Ahlberg,
Category Manager Meat/Charcuterie at ICA.

The new segment will provide value both in terms of environmental impact
and as a healthy and affordable option to the traditional meat segment.
The next step is going to the market to validate the products on a large
scale. Mycorena envisions the new food segment of hybrid products as a
stepping stone to increase the acceptance of alternative proteins while
taking necessary steps toward a sustainable food system.
