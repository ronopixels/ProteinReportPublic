Specialty enzyme company, Biocatalysts Ltd, have delivered the first
customer product that was fermented and processed in their
state-of-the-art enzyme manufacturing facility. The unique enzyme was
scaled up and commercialised in less than 10 months to meet the demands
of the customers' manufacturing schedule.

It is a testament to the team that the plant commissioning, validation,
and production of the first commercial product was done during these
unprecedented times and shows Biocatalysts Ltd.'s commitment to
providing large-scale fermentation services.

To ensure a reliable and robust service the manufacturing facility has
been designed to deliver a unique, fully automated 'LEAN' manufacturing
process, ensuring maximum yield recovery at every stage of the process.

The extension is capable of *E. coli*, *Pichia* and *Yarrowia*
fermentations and subsequent down-stream-processing. The new
fermentation capacity increases their existing portfolio, extending
their fermentation scales to 3L, 75L, 750L and 10,000L and has been
designed to accommodate future growth.

The whole process is controlled by state-of-the-art Siemens software to
maximise capacity and enhance efficiencies, guaranteeing world-class
support and service.

Coupled with their award-winning enzyme discovery, development and
manufacturing process Biocatalysts Ltd truly have a unique breadth of
offering in the biotechnology marketplace.

Craig Galeozzie, Director of Operations at Biocatalysts Ltd, commented,
"*The strategic planning, design and subsequent installation has been an
incredible 3-year journey, ultimately delivering a conceptual 'LEAN'
process that provides us with a unique facility unrivalled in the
industry.*

*Built on the foundations of teamwork, the extension project is another
example of the extraordinary commitment, professionalism and dedication
of our staff to exceed our customers' expectations as we further develop
the facility and strengthen our marketability.*"
