The Spanish startup Cocuus has raised 2,5 million euros in its Pre
Series A funding round for its innovative process for producing plant or
cell-based animal protein food analogs. The company achieved this round
after completing Eatable Adventures\' acceleration program, one of the
top three global accelerators for food tech startups.

The round was led by Big Idea Ventures, the global alternative protein
fund, the U.S. multinational Cargill Ventures, the Spanish accelerator
Eatable Adventures and Tech Transfer UPV. With a capital injection of
this size, the startup can scale its business model and expand into
other international markets, enabling them to utilize their disruptive
3D bioprinting and robotics technologies to create more sustainable and
nutritious food products.

Patxi Larumbe, CEO and founder of Cocuus states *\"We are very proud to
have attracted the interest of international investors with this round
of financing. Thanks to this capital injection we will be able to bring
our technology within reach of corporations that want to print proteins
on an industrial scale\"*. In addition, the Founder and Managing General
Partner of Big Idea Ventures, Andrew D Ive, also highlights "*At Big
Idea Ventures, we invest in technology which impacts the alternative
protein industry's entire value chain. Cocuus' technology addresses a
major pain point of structured plant- and cell-based meat production
methods: scalability. We are thrilled to support this innovative team
and we look forward to seeing their scalable food technology making an
impact across the world.\"* 

On the other hand, José Luis Cabañero, CEO and founder of Eatable
Adventures notes, *\"The Spanish foodtech startups' ecosystem is
consolidating very quickly, attracting major investors and international
corporations. Through Eatable Adventures, we offer our services to
startups and corporations around the globe to accelerate the process of
transformation and innovation in the food value chain\".*

As Cabañero points out, this current environmental and world population
scenario calls for a rethinking of production methods to achieve a much
more sustainable and efficient food system. According to FAO data, in
2050, in order to feed a population of 9.1 billion, food production will
have to increase by 70% and meat production by more than 200 million
tons.

Cocuus, along with MOA Foodtech, Proppos, H2hydroponics, and Innomy have
been selected as finalists for the first edition of Spain Foodtech, the
acceleration program of Eatable Adventures supported by the National
Center for Technology and Food Safety (CNTA) and ICEX Spain Export and
Investment.

Cocuus has been awarded by the international Quality Innovation Award
(QIA) in the category of Innovation in Microenterprises and Startups,
after winning the 2021 national award.
