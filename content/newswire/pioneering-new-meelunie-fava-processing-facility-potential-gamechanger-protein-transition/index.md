**Amsterdam, 28 May 2021** -- In keeping with its pioneering commitment
to the protein transition, Meelunie has announced it will be opening a
fava protein isolate manufacturing facility in Hedensted, Denmark in
October 2022.

Meelunie, a leading global supplier of plant-based ingredients, believes
fava will play a pivotal role in the protein transition. Helping meet
the growing demand for plant-based proteins in ways that also address
deforestation, inefficiencies in global agriculture and other
climate-related challenges.

The facility will be equipped with cutting-edge processing technology
from SiccaDania, and employ a breakthrough process methodology developed
by the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) following 17 years' research.

"The UCPH breakthrough is two-fold," explains Gijs van Elst, the
project's leader at Meelunie. "First, they've managed to remove the fava
bean's bitter taste, making it perfect for use in human food
applications ranging from dairy and meat alternatives to sports
nutrition and gluten-free products. And UCPH's process is also more
efficient, so we're able to valorise the entire bean."

Meelunie CEO Marco Heering sees this processing facility as a
significant step forward. "The limited availability and suitability of
local alternatives to soya has been a handbrake on the protein
transition for some years. Because the fava bean thrives in non-tropical
climates, such as Europe and North America, this facility can be a
genuine gamechanger."

The facility will be located near land ideally suited to cultivating
fava beans and produce high-quality fava ingredients. Appropriately
enough, the factory design is also climate-friendly. "Water used in the
production process will be filtered and reused to create a circular
system," says Van Elst, "and we'll capture heat generated in production
for reuse in the local municipality's heating system."
