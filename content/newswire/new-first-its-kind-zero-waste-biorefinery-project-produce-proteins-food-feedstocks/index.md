Ten partners from industry and research launch a project (known as
'PLENITUDE') to build a first-of-its-kind, large-scale, integrated
biorefinery facility to produce proteins for food from low-cost
sustainable feedstocks.

This project has received €17m funding from the Bio Based Industries
Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) under the European Union's Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 838104, and
is the largest flagship grant awarded to a UK company by BBI JU.
PLENITUDE brings together 10 key players in the bioeconomy spanning 5 EU
member states and representing every link in the value chain. This
includes expertise in primary processing and industrial operations
(Alcogroup SA), biotechnology (3F BIO Limited), product development and
applications (International Flavors & Fragrances I.F.F. B.V), primary
research and protein expertise (Wageningen University) a specialist
consultants covering marketing and sustainability (Bridge2Food, Life
Cycle Engineering Srl), and three end-users covering food categories
(Mosa Meat, Vivera, ABP) as well as one end-user covering bio-plastics
(Lactips).

The project addresses the protein challenge by integrating two
established processes into a flagship, large-scale, first-of-its-kind,
biorefinery producing bioethanol and sustainable food protein. The
process takes a proportion of the sustainable cereal crops that feed the
biorefinery to create a feedstock for the fermentation process that
produces ABUNDA® mycoprotein. \[1\] \[2\]

Olivier Van Rompaey, Senior Vice President AlcoGroup, highlighted: 'With
our core business in sustainable biorefineries, the Plenitude project
offers a great opportunity to develop sustainable protein alongside a
range of leading partners'.

Commenting on the announcement, Dean Holroyd, Group Technical and
Sustainability Director, ABP, said: "As a business that produces a
variety of products for millions of consumers around the world we are
fully committed to ensure that we continuously innovate our product
range to include as many tastes and diet choices as possible. Today's
announcement is the latest development on our R&D journey which also
extends to improving the sustainability of our beef and lamb products
and the introduction and combination of meat free and plant-based
products." "We operate the highest standards in sustainability across
our business and we are keen to be actively involved in addressing the
challenges of feeding a rapidly growing population and sustainably as
possible."

With initial output capacity of 16k tonnes per annum, this flagship
project will increase the availability of sustainable, high-quality food
protein. The collaboration between the biorefinery operator, food
producers and technology providers will create new cross-sector
interconnections, new bio-based value chains, and new bio-based
'consumer' products.

**About the Joint Undertaking on **[**Bio-based Industries
(BBI)**](http://www.bbi-europe.eu/)\
The Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking is a new €3.7 billion
Public-Private Partnership between the EU and the [Bio-based Industries
Consortium](http://biconsortium.eu/). Operating under Horizon 2020, it
is driven by the Vision and Strategic Innovation and Research Agenda
(SIRA) developed by the industry, aimed at increasing investment in the
development of a sustainable bio-based industry sector in Europe. It
aims at providing environmental and socio-economic benefits for European
citizens, increasing the competitiveness of Europe and contributing to
establishing Europe as a key player in research, demonstration and
deployment of advanced bio-based products and biofuels. The BBI Joint
Undertaking will also play an important role in achieving a bioeconomy
in Europe.  The objectives of the BBI Joint Undertaking are to
contribute to a more resource efficient and sustainable low-carbon
economy and to increasing economic growth and employment, in particular
in rural areas, by developing sustainable and competitive bio-based
industries in Europe, based on advanced biorefineries that source their
biomass sustainably.

**About 3F BIO**\
3F BIO is a biotechnology company that addresses the global need for
sustainable high-quality protein & fibre food.  3F BIO uses the benefits
of a patented zero waste process\[2\]  to produce ABUNDA® mycoprotein
using the natural process of fermentation.
