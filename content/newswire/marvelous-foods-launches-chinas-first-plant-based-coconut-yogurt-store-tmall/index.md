BEIJING, China, May 20, 2021 \-- China plant-based snacking company
Marvelous Foods has launched a Tmall flagship store for its signature
product Yeyo Coconut Yogurt. Yeyo is China's first plant-based coconut
yogurt with zero added sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners. Its
Tmall store is the first-ever plant-based coconut yogurt flagship store
on China's leading e-commerce platform.

Yeyo's product and brand design is positioned to tap into the
premiumization of two rapidly growing categories, China's USD \$17
billion dollar yogurt market and USD \$433 billion dollar snacking
market. "We created this product to ride the trend of snacking
premiumization that's taking off in tier 1 cities in the
health-conscious age of COVID-19," says founder Christiana Zhu. "With
very high new product development rates compared to other categories,
snacking offers a great entry point for innovative new plant-based 2.0
products."

The initial launch features three SKUs priced at 15RMB per 100g unit.
The range includes a 'pure' sugar-free flavor, plus two yogurt-granola
cups designed to provide a convenient and fun snack for on-the-go
urbanites featuring seasonal fruit and nut granola toppings that can be
added for extra flavor and nutrition.

Yeyo's new commercial-scale product is a result of extensive formulation
R&D in partnership with globally leading ingredients company DSM. "We
took onboard many learnings during the artisanal stage of our product
over the past years," says Ms Zhu. "We are proud to have created
something which has tested on par or above for taste versus leading
dairy yogurts during focus group sessions with our key target market."

Ms Zhu first created Yeyo to address a personal need for dairy-free,
sugar-free yogurt. When Yeyo organically grew into a popular local
artisanal brand in Beijing, her sister Athena left her senior management
post at Heineken China to help scale it together.  

Marvelous Foods received seed-stage investment from Lever VC to create
Yeyo's commercial product. The new product has been receiving great
customer feedback and reached number 4 on Tmall's "fastest growing
chilled dairy products" list 3 weeks into launch. The company is now
seeking Pre-A investment to fuel the momentum.

"Plant-based dairy beverage sales grew 800% on Tmall in 2020, so we
believe we are in for an exciting 2021. We welcome any investors that
would like to tap into this green and growing opportunity in the world's
hungriest market to get in touch."
