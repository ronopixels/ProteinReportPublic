***MeaTech believes the collaboration will produce game-changing hybrid
alternative meat products that are both delicious and nutritious and
better resemble conventional meat***

Rehovot, Israel, May 20, 2022 --- MeaTech 3D Ltd. (Nasdaq: MITC), an
international deep-tech food company at the forefront of the cultured
meat industry, is pleased to announce that its wholly owned Belgian
subsidiary, Peace of Meat, has signed a joint development agreement with
ENOUGH, a leader in the field of mycoprotein, a fungi-based fermented
food ingredient. The collaboration aims to accelerate MeaTech's
go-to-market strategy for hybrid products.

This innovative initiative will combine Peace of Meat's unique expertise
in cultured avian development with ENOUGH's cutting-edge mycoprotein
ingredient to create game-changing hybrid alternative meat products.
Cultured avian fat biomass will provide the signature flavors, aromas
and textures of conventional meat. ENOUGH's mycoprotein will add high
nutritional value with rich protein and fiber content and essential
amino acids, zinc and iron.

At a recent MeaTech tasting event, MeaTech's chef prepared hybrid
chicken nuggets that included Peace of Meat's cultured chicken fat
biomass. The feedback from attendees, which included prominent food
industry investors, was unanimously positive. Last September, Peace of
Meat successfully produced 700 grams of pure cultured chicken fat
biomass in a single production run. On the heels of that breakthrough, a
pilot plant and R&D facility in Belgium are planned to begin scaled-up
production in 2023.

ENOUGH will also have its flagship pilot plant in the south of the
Netherlands not far from Peace of Meat's facility. The companies' shared
product vision and commercialization goals make this an ideal
partnership for bringing innovative and sustainable new products to the
hybrid food market.

**Dirk von Heinrichshorst, CEO of Peace of Meat, said**: "This joint
venture with ENOUGH is a milestone toward advancing our vision to use
cultured fat biomass as an ingredient for developing delicious and
innovative hybrid food products that better mimic farm-raised meat."

**Arik Kaufman, CEO of MeaTech, said**: "We are excited to sign a
collaboration agreement with ENOUGH, a global leader in mycoprotein as
an ingredient, to accelerate our commercialization of next-generation
meat substitutes --- hybrid products with cultured fat biomass. These
game changing, primarily plant-based products promise to offer a meatier
taste and mouthfeel that is closer to conventional meat products."

**Jim Laird, CEO of ENOUGH, said**: "We believe that the future of
sustainable protein will include a mix of plant- fermentation- and
cell-based products. Therefore, we are delighted to combine our
fermented biomass with the cultured chicken fat biomass being developed
by MeaTech's subsidiary, Peace of Meat."

**About ENOUGH**

ENOUGH (formerly 3F BIO) is a food-tech company with technology to grow
the most sustainable source of food protein.

ENOUGH is pioneering high-scale sustainable protein production to tackle
the combined issues of feeding a growing global population and the
unsustainable impact of traditional protein farming.

ENOUGH grows non-animal protein by fermenting fungi using renewable
feedstocks to grow the most sustainable source of food protein. This
produces ABUNDA® mycoprotein, a complete food ingredient that contains
all essential amino acids and is high in dietary fiber. It is versatile
and can be made into alternative/animal-free meat, seafood and dairy
products.

ENOUGH is a semi-finalist in "XPRIZE Feed the Next Billion," a \$15M
prize competition which targets scalable whole cut alternatives that
mimic animal protein. The company is already producing whole muscle
chicken formats that it demonstrated earlier this year at a tasting for
1,000 guests at Future Food-Tech in San Francisco.

The company has 50+ employees, spanning 17 nationalities located in
Scotland, England and the Netherlands. ENOUGH is building a
first-of-its-kind mycoprotein factory (60,000 metric-ton capacity) which
will initially grow 10,000 metric tons per annum and be operational
later this year.

The company will supply ABUNDA mycoprotein as a B2B food ingredient to
consumer brands and retailers, addressing the need for high-scale supply
of healthy and sustainable protein to address a rapidly growing market.
