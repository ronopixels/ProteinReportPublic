Alameda, CA -- March 13, 2023 // [Shiru](https://www.shiru.com/), an
AI-powered discovery and development company for novel ingredients, has
launched its first product: [OleoPro™](https://www.shiru.com/oleopro/).
The ingredient will be publicly showcased for the first time at San
Francisco's Future Food-Tech conference as part of a plant-based crispy
chik'n karaage developed by [Nourish
Ventures](https://nourishventures.com/), the corporate venture capital
arm of [Griffith Foods](https://griffithfoods.com/). 

OleoPro is a novel, plant protein-based fat ingredient for use in a
range of alternative protein food products. Combining plant proteins and
unsaturated plant-based oil, OleoPro is a high-performance, sustainable,
and nutritious alternative fat ingredient. It enables a 90% reduction in
saturated fat while enhancing technical performance in alternative meats
when compared to commonly used, environmentally-taxing structured fats.
OleoPro is self-standing, holding its shape at room temperature; browns
when cooked; and delivers a juicy, fatty mouthfeel in plant-based meat
applications. 

"At Shiru, we think consumers shouldn't have to compromise on taste or
texture to make sustainable, nutritious food choices, and we know novel
ingredients are crucial to unlocking the next generation of plant-based
foods," said Dr. Jasmin Hume, Shiru's founder and CEO, "Oils commonly
used in plant-based meats today like palm and coconut are disastrous for
the environment and aren't great from a health perspective either.
OleoPro is a categorical upgrade, bringing all the juiciness and
fattiness we expect from conventional meats to plant-based, but with a
much improved nutritional profile and without tearing down the
rainforest."

OleoPro is patent-pending, and comes from Shiru's proprietary technology
platform, [Flourish™](https://www.shiru.com/approach/), which leverages
AI to generate unique plant protein insights. Flourish uncovered highly
functional proteins that, when combined with more sustainable oils
through a novel process, create an ingredient that looks and behaves
like traditional animal fat.

​​"We're thrilled to be partnering with Shiru on the launch of their first
ingredient, OleoPro. At Nourish Ventures, we understand food
formulation, and recognize the historical challenges associated with
delivering a true, fat-like experience for alternative proteins. OleoPro
is a real game-changer, and we're excited by its potential to impact the
alternative protein industry," said Simon Burton, managing director of
Nourish Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Griffith Foods.

While initial development has focused on plant-based meat applications
across multiple formats, Shiru is exploring additional applications,
including plant-based dairy and personal care products. Shiru is
currently sampling OleoPro to prioritize initial launch partners, with
commercial production beginning later this year. To request a sample or
