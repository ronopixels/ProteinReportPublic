***Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit, Singapore, October 26-28***

SINGAPORE --- The fifth annual **Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation
Summit** presents 50 regional and international innovators who are
pioneering breakthrough technologies in agri-food, to ensure food
security and build capacity in Asia and beyond.

Asia's agri-food system needs help. With global shocks highlighting
import link weaknesses, rapid economic growth, and huge structural
transformation across the region, the need to build strong, resilient
supply chains has never been more urgent.

*"Given the complex challenges Asia\'s food system faces, the need for
fast-paced, scalable innovation has never been greater. The summit
creates opportunities for entrepreneurs to connect directly with
investors and corporate partners, to bring their solutions to scale and
change the agri-food landscape for the benefit of all. I am excited to
witness the collaborations stemming from the conference this October"*
says Theresa Flach, the summit's Conference Producer and technology
scout.

Start-ups are celebrated throughout the summit programme, with a
pre-summit pitch day, themed innovation showcases across the three-day
agenda, and a dedicated start-up exhibition space.

**Innovation Showcases**

12 start-ups from the Asia-Pacific region will pitch their solution to a
panel of industry judges across four themed innovation showcases
covering Agtech, Foodtech, Aquaculture and CEA & Vertical Farming.

***AgTech Takes the Stage***

-   **Qzense** (India) aims to minimise and eliminate post-harvest food
    loss with its IoT solution that quickly and accurately grades fresh
    food. The technology employs a unique combination of near-infrared
    spectral sensors and olfactory sensors for analysis of internal
    spoilage, ripeness, sweetness, and shelf life.
-   **Boomitra** (India & US) uses satellite and AI to measure a variety
    of soil properties including soil carbon, soil moisture and
    nitrogen, and provides an end-to-end solution where farmers are able
    to grow more with less through carbon farming.
-   **CH4 Global** (Australia) provides seaweed-based Asparagopsis
    products to farmers worldwide so they can dramatically reduce the
    methane emissions of their livestock and realize significant value
    in the process.

***CEA & Vertical Farming Spotlight***

-   **Future Farms** (Malaysia) aims to season-proof agriculture by
    building decentralized, remote-controlled farms. Future Farms
    promise that their services provide endless customization and are
    infinitely scalable.
-   **Grobrix** (Singapore) presents a unique solution to indoor farming
    by combining the best of furniture with farming. Its soilless
    vertical farming design offers a cleaner, simpler, more efficient
    way to grow fresh, healthy food.
-   **Distar Fresh** (Thailand) is a subscription service indoor farm
    that delivers pesticide-free medical grade vegetables from farm to
    door that are harvested all-year round.

***Blue Food Shark Tank***

-   **Forte Biotech** (Singapore) provides diagnostic solutions to allow
    prawn farmers to 'earn more', with its patented product 'RAPID'
    (Robust Accurate Prawn Infection Detector) -- developed in
    partnership with NUS -- that enables farmers to detect diseases
    early and take mitigative action without the need for expert help.
-   **Sea Green** (Singapore) is an ecosystem services provider, with a
    mission to deliver connectivity and services to the growing seaweed
    industry. Using blockchain technology, the company will maximise
    financial service integration for smallholders, and harness data to
    drive research into the potential of macroalgae.
-   **Magalarva** (Indonesia) aims to provide sustainable protein for
    feed by bio-converting organic sidestreams using Black Soldier Fly
    larvae. The company is closing the loop by eliminating organic waste
    from producers including food and beverage factories, hotels and
    plantations.

***Raising the Stakes in Food-Tech***

-   **SeaSpire** (India) blends cutting-edge technologies, digital tools
    and nutrition packed plant-based ingredients to develop plant-based
    cousins of the world\'s favourite marine species. SeaSpire\'s
    bioprinting tech promises whole muscle structures with no compromise
    on taste, texture and affordability.
-   **Magic Valley** (Australia) is an Australian food company
    developing healthy and delicious cultivated meat products. Focused
    on building a better global food system, Magic Valley believes the
    solution is cultivated meat, where meat is grown without the animal.
-   **Float Foods** (Singapore) is a company that believes in the power
    of plants. Singaporeans consume 2 billion eggs per year, but 74% of
    them are imported, a fact that became a problem during the
    pandemic - which is when Float Foods started developing Asia\'s
    first plant-based whole egg, OnlyEg.

Industry judges include leaders from **Main Sequence Ventures**,
**Spacetime Ventures**, **Innoget**, **Alune Aquaculture**,
**Aqua-Spark**, **VisVires New Protein** and **Unovis Asset
Management**.

**Start-Up Exhibition Powered by True**

A buzzing part of the networking exhibition at the summit, the Start-Up
Exhibition Powered by True Search is where delegates can connect with
exciting international start-ups face-to-face.

*\"As a founder-led firm with innovation at the core of our culture, we
are thrilled to sponsor a summit featuring so many disruptive and
purpose-driven companies. The transformation of our food industry is
essential, and we are grateful for the opportunity to provide talent
solutions for these world-changing businesses\"* says Desmond O\'Brien,
Partner at True Search.
