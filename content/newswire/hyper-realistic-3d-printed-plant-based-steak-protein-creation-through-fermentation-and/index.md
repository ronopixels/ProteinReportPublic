Eatable Adventures, one of the three main global foodtech accelerators
celebrated last week an investors' demo day for the first cohort of
*Spain FoodTech*, its main program. Five startups showcased their
progress after a 6 months high-performance acceleration program, focused
on building strong technology-based startups in the agri-food value
chain.

More than 200 startups applied for the first edition of Spain Foodtech
which includes foreign entrepreneurs willing to settle their
headquarters in Spain from other countries. 

The agri-food sector plays a strategic role in the Spanish economy,
accounting for 9.2% of GDP and 11.9% of employment, while experiencing a
revolution in the application of technology with more than 400 active
Foodtech startups. In this context Spain FoodTech Startups Program was
born, the acceleration program promoted by Eatable Adventure and
supported by the National Center for Food Technology and Safety (CNTA)
and ICEX Spanish government leg for Export and Investment. 

The 5 selected startups, Cocuus, H2hydroponics, Innomy, Moa foodtech and
Proppos, have received a personalized acceleration plan with access to
the technological support of CNTA, focused on achieving technological
development and consolidation. During this period, they have seen their
business models reinforced and evaluated, their technological
applications reformulated and tested, they have built a proper
go-to-market plan and received help in their search for funding in order
to scale. All these efforts have resulted in a boost for the startups
valuation, which has been multiplied by more than 6 times, with an
average valuation of 7,5m € which is being reflected in the resulting
funding rounds.

Hyper realistic 3D printed plant based steak, proteins creations thought
fermentation, mycelium based burgers, check out technologies and
hydroponic vertical and indoor farming are the five disruptive
technologies protagonists of the program, developed by:

-   COCUUS: presented its MimETHICA platform, designed for large-scale
    bio-printing of plant-based products analogous to recreate animal
    protein, from steaks to salmon sashimi.
-   PROPPOS AI: applies artificial intelligence and computer vision to
    offer an unattended Point of Sale solution for foodservice.
-   INNOMY: has developed a range of animal protein substitute products
    based on the cultivation of mushroom mycelium.
-   H2HYDROPONICS: has designed and operated hydroponic vertical farming
    and indoor farming facilities in the most extreme climates. They
    have launched Atlantic Farms, a concept of local and technological
    production, which will revolutionize the 4th RANGE salad sector,
    implementing a sustainable production model in the same communities
    where it is consumed.
-   MOA Foodtech: combines biotechnology and artificial intelligence to
    convert waste and by-products from the agri-food industry into a
    \'\'next generation protein\'\' with a high nutritional value and is
    100% sustainable.

*"Several of the Spain Foodtech startups are disruptive at a global
level, they are already getting solid traction with leading
international investors and corporations. They have managed to generate
amazing intellectual property which is having a strong social impact. It
is a quantitative and qualitative success, and the value of the startups
has multiplied by 6.3 during the program\"* affirms José Luis Cabañero
CEO and founder of Eatable Adventures. 

Spain Foodtech program is run annually, the applications for the next
cohort are open for the 2022 edition on

September 30th.
