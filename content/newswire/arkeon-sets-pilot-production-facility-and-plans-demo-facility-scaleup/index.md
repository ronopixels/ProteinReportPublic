*Vienna, Austria, July 6, 2023 -- Biotech startup Arkeon transforms CO2
into functional protein ingredients using gas fermentation. The
commissioning of a 150L pilot production plant marks an important step
forward and paves the way for the company\'s future scaling.*

Biotech startup Arkeon successfully raised over 10 million Euros in
capital to date to build out its proprietary technology for the direct
conversion of carbon dioxide into protein ingredients. The recently
commissioned pilot production plant in Vienna\'s Seestadt Innovation Hub
represents a significant step forward for the further development of the
company's production process and the expansion of its infrastructure.
Equipped with a 150L bioreactor system, it serves to progressively
improve the process and lays a solid biotechnological foundation for
future large-scale production. The plant was built in cooperation with
Steamtec, Böhm Stadtbaumeister & Gebäudetechnik GmbH, Kanzler-Dach,
Bioengineering, RW Serviceteam, and others.

The achieved capacity of 150L forms the foundation for the next step of
the scaling plan, a demo facility with a 3000L bioreactor system. **"The
successful implementation of our pilot production plant represents a
solid basis and illustrates that our company has set up the technical
foundation to unlock our production technology at large scale. It is an
essential step on our way to scale to large commercial production
outputs", says Dr. Günther Bochmann, Technological Project Lead of
Arkeon.**

Last week, the Vienna Business Agency initiated the construction of the
Technology Centre Seestadt. The project aims to provide additional
production and office space for innovative startups, including Arkeon,
and its upcoming demo facility plans. The commissioning of the 3000L
bioreactor is scheduled for the end of 2024 and is expected to mark the
company\'s entry into commercial production capacity. Subsequently,
Arkeon plans to expand its production to full-scale bioreactors with
volumes of 800 -- 1,000 m3. Already now, partnerships have been
established with global companies to develop new and innovative protein
applications for functional food and beverage products for the food
industry.
