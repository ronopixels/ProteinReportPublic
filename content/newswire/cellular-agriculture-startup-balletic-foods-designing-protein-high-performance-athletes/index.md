SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, USA: Balletic Foods, an alternative protein
startup based in California, announces plans to produce animal-free
protein optimized for the sports nutrition market.

Balletic Foods uses a proprietary fermentation technology to produce its
first product, Balletic Proteinâ„¢. The output of the scalable process are
pure proteins that are designed and engineered for high performance,
ready to become the core building blocks for a variety of food and
supplement applications.

"Highly optimized proteins will be the future of sports nutrition"
explains Anita Broellochs, Founder and CEO of Balletic Foods. "We're
seeing a huge wave in alternative protein technology, but a lot of the
products are not designed for health and muscle recovery."

Cellular agriculture technology is making headwinds as the demand for
protein worldwide rapidly increases. Protein plays an important role for
individuals who are physically active as it can reduce muscle soreness
and promote muscle repair. Balletic Foods has identified key
opportunities to develop an efficient protein that is optimized for high
performance activities and supports muscle protein synthesis.

In comparison to plant-based proteins, animal-based proteins
traditionally have a high protein score, a measure of the protein
quality found in foods, suggesting they are more usable by our body for
general growth, maintenance, and repair. This is due to their high
digestibility and complete essential amino acid profile. However,
traditional methods of sourcing animal-based proteins are not
sustainable. Balletic Foods is a mission driven organization committed
to eliminating the exploitation of animals in the agricultural system.
