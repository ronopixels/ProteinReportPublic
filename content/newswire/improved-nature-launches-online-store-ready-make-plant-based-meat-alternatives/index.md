Improved Nature, a plant-based protein company, is excited to introduce
its e-commerce
website, [ImprovedNatureDirect.com](https://improvednaturedirect.com/).

The new online shop exclusively features the company's dehydrated
Nature's PRIME plant-based meat alternative product line. The
revolutionary Nature's PRIME products are made with only one ingredient
and are available for purchase in 8 oz. bags, as well as bulk orders.
Nature's PRIME is ready-to-make plant-based protein offered in a variety
of shapes and sizes, including filets, nuggets, poppers, tenders
and more.

Improved Nature's innovative and proprietary process turns non-GMO soy
protein into plant-based food that replicates the texture and experience
of eating meat. The company's Nature's PRIME products are easy to
prepare and have a shelf life of up to two years with no preservatives
added. An 8 oz. bag of Nature's PRIME product equals 2.5 pounds of
alternative meat once hydrated.

"More than half of Americans are increasing their consumption of
plant-based foods. With our Nature's PRIME product line now online,
consumers can more easily enjoy and incorporate healthy plant-based
protein into their regular meal planning because it's a 1 to 1
replacement for meat," said President and CEO of Improved Nature, Dr.
Rody Hawkins.

"Perhaps the best part about our Nature's PRIME products is that they
can replace proteins like chicken, beef or pork in any recipe just by
adding flavoring. During the cooking process, Nature's PRIME products
can be spiced, marinated and added to your favorite recipes to create
exactly what you're craving."

Because plant-based foods offer health and nutritional benefits,
consumers are highly motivated to try them. Plant-based diets have been
linked to a number of health benefits, including reducing the risk of
heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cognitive decline. With Nature's
PRIME, consumers also get the nine essential amino acids human bodies
need because soy is a complete protein.

Consumers are interested in trying plant-based foods for a variety of
reasons, including the environmental benefits. Research suggests that if
Americans shifted their diets away from meat and toward plant-based
protein, it would significantly decrease carbon-dioxide emissions.
Improved Nature uses sustainably sourced soy to provide high-quality
nutrition. Plant protein is a more efficient and scalable source of food
for the growing global population as it requires less land and water
to produce.
