Wednesday, November 16, 2022 (Alameda, CA) --
[Shiru](https://shiru.com), a functional ingredients discovery company,
announced today that it will present a new state-of-the-art AI method
for predicting protein subcellular localization, with broad implications
for food alternative proteins, health care, pharma, personal care, and
more. 

The paper, entitled "Improving Protein Subcellular Localization
Prediction with Structural Prediction & Graph Neural Networks," will be
presented at [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), the leading conference of the
AI research community, on Saturday, December 3, 2022, at the [Machine
Learning for Structural Biology](https://www.mlsb.io/) Workshop.

Predicting where a protein localizes or resides in a cell is a huge
challenge in biotechnology. Where a protein resides is an important
indicator of its function and manufacturability. Many processes, such as
disease mechanisms, drug performance, regulation of metabolic processes,
and signaling cascades, depend on a protein's localization. 

Previous work in the field has shown how Language Models (LM) and Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) can independently provide efficient localization
predictions when trained on protein DNA sequences and 3D structures,
respectively. Shiru AI researchers created a method for combining the
two different kinds of protein representations used by LM and GNN, then
used real-world data to show how ensembling them outperforms the
reigning state-of-the-art method.

"This paper validates our approach and offers a generalized method that
opens new possibilities toward creating a sequence-to-function map of
the protein universe," says Geoffroy Dubourg-Felonneau, Shiru's Machine
Learning Lead and the paper's lead author. "We are continually
developing new and improved methods for protein representation, and we
show in this case that the combination of protein structure information
and language modeling yields a significant improvement on the task of
subcellular localization prediction."

"Shiru is pioneering the use of advanced machine learning techniques to
reveal proteins with similar function but dissimilar sequence and
structure relative to a target protein," says Lawrence Lee, Shiru's
Chief Technology Officer. "This new approach enhances our ability to
uncover the hidden food functionality of proteins." 

The new AI method is the latest from Shiru's science and technology
team. In September 2022, Shiru was awarded a [key
patent](https://www.shiru.com/post/ingredient-biotech-startup-shiru-awarded-key-patent-for-protein-discovery-platform/) for
its protein discovery platform, which covers machine learning combined
with lab analysis for developing naturally-occurring proteins as
functional food ingredients.
Shiru's [Flourish](https://www.shiru.com/approach/)™ technology is in
active use in partnerships with global food leaders Puratos and CP
Kelco. Shiru also recently announced that Impossible Foods
veteran [Ranjani
Varadan](https://www.shiru.com/post/in-conversation-with-dr-ranjani-varadan-shirus-new-chief-scientific-officer/) joined
as Chief Scientific Officer.
