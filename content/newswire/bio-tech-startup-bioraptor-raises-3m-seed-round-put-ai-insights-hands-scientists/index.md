Tel Aviv, Israel - \[October 31, 2022\] Today BioRaptor announces a \$3M
funding round to innovate the biotech industry by putting the power of
AI-generated insights into the hands of every scientist.

The round was led by lool Ventures and CPT Capital and was joined by
FoodHack and a number of strategic angel investors.

BioRaptor is building the operating system for biology research and
manufacturing - leveraging state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to
present a clear understanding of data and creating deep, actionable
insights, integrated within existing workflows. BioRaptor is already
improving its customer's bottom line. With this round, BioRaptor will
ramp up development and onboard additional customers.

Whilst synthetic biology approaches offer incredible potential for some
of humanity's greatest problems, the path from scientific research to
commercialisation is a long and difficult  journey. Stakeholders face
huge technical challenges and often lack the requisite tools to guide
them on an optimal path for a cost-effective, quality product. BioRaptor
helps scientists and biotechnologists innovate faster.

"Scientists are spending so much time on manual analysis rather than
focusing on planning and research. As a software engineer, I've
experienced first hand the shift in the past 15 years and we've come to
take for granted the work that's been offloaded from us via advanced
tools. We want to bring that to Biology." said **Ori Zakin**,
**BioRaptor**'s co-founder and CEO.

\"BioRaptor truly shows how AI and Big data enable scientists to
accelerate innovation and impact our lives for the better.  We are
thrilled to join Ori and Yaron on this journey, and to see how their
product empowers the scientific community across FoodTech, drug
discovery, synthetic biology industries, and beyond." **Avichay
Nissenbaum,** General Partner, **lool ventures**

"As experienced investors in alternative proteins, we have seen the
challenges in bringing synthetic biology products to market. Under Ori
and Yaron's leadership,  we believe the BioRaptor platform can play a
critical role in enabling the world's most disruptive and innovative
companies to commercialise their products in a quicker, cost-effective
manner'. **Harry Kalms**, Investor, **CPT Capital**

"We hear from so many companies working with different fermentation
techniques who need an end-to-end data tool across their development and
production process. We are excited to back BioRaptor who have a proven
track record in the medical industry, and are now enabling FoodTech
companies to use data-driven insights to lead better experiments and
increase their yield." **Erika Hombert,** Venture Analyst, **FoodHack
Syndicate**
