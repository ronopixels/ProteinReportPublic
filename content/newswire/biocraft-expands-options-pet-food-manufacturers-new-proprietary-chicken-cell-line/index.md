VIENNA, Austria -- June 28, 2023 -- [BioCraft Pet

the first biotech company to develop cultured meat for the pet food
market, announced today it has derived and characterized a chicken cell
line for both cat and dog food, adding another meat ingredient to its
portfolio that already includes cultured mouse meat.

BioCraft's proprietary cultured chicken offers all essential nutrients
cats and dogs need, without chemical and bacterial contaminants,
antibiotics, steroids or other hormones such as can be found in
traditional meat. Derived from stem cells, BioCraft's chicken is neither
genetically modified nor immortalized. While it is common to license
cell lines from third-party providers, BioCraft's cell lines are wholly
owned by the company, with the chicken stem cell line being derived by
BioCraft's in-house stem cell scientist and veterinarian Rupal Tewari,
MSc, PhD, DVM.

Although chicken is among the top allergens for both cats and dogs, it
is still one of the most commonly used ingredients in pet food. As such,
BioCraft has developed the chicken cell line to meet the demand of pet
food manufacturer partners, and consumers, for conventional species.

"While cultured mouse meat---the ancestral diet of the cat---remains our
primary focus for cat food, the new chicken cell line for cats or dogs
is ideal for pet food manufacturers and ultimately pet parents who lean
toward more traditional meat ingredients," said BioCraft founder and CEO
Dr. Shannon Falconer. "Dr. Tewari's rare combination of expertise in
stem cell and veterinary science are unique in the industry, and give us
an advantage over every other cultured meat company."

BioCraft is working directly with pet food manufacturers interested in
transitioning their conventional meat ingredients to supply-chain
stable, sustainable, safe, humane cultured meat. BioCrafted meat offers
pet food companies a more uniform raw material that is significantly
less likely to carry any pathogens such as Salmonella, E. coli, and
other common fecal-borne bacteria that lead to costly recalls.

BioCraft's chicken is created with the consistency of the "meat slurry"
used in conventional pet food manufacturing, and can be used as a
one-to-one replacement in wet or dry foods, treats, and fresh pet foods.
BioCrafted meats are nutritionally robust, with all required protein,
key vitamins, fats and amino acids such as taurine---a nutrient
typically lost during high-heat processing during the rendering process
of conventional meat, then added back in synthetic form for
nutritionally complete pet foods.

BioCrafted meat grows in a controlled and pathogen-free environment
surrounded by a liquid medium of vitamins and minerals formulated
without fetal bovine serum (FBS), a process ingredient inhumanely
obtained from the slaughter of pregnant cows that has been commonly used
to produce other cultured meats.

Conventional meat production---for pets and people---has devastating
consequences, including climate change, animal cruelty and risks to
public health. Animals are fed diets laden with antibiotics, a primary
contributor to antibiotic resistance in humans and pets, and hormonal
steroids to accelerate their growth. The intensive confinement of
animals to slaughter for meat is contributing to air and water
pollution, deforestation, desertification and ocean dead zones, while
also promoting deadly outbreaks and zoonotic diseases. More than 25
percent of the environmental impact of animal agriculture is attributed
to feeding pets in the U.S. alone: if cats and dogs occupied their own
country, they would be the world's fifth largest meat-consuming nation.

**About BioCraft**\
BioCraft Pet Nutrition, founded in 2016, is the first and only biotech
company to create meat-based pet food that doesn't come at the expense
of slaughtering other animals. BioCraft was also the first to create a
proprietary growth medium as an alternative to fetal bovine serum (FBS),
helping reduce production costs by well over an order of magnitude and
representing a key step towards commercial scale. Today, the BioCraft
team includes a roster of PhD scientists, a veterinarian, and serial
entrepreneurs, all focused on taking animals out of the supply chain by
producing the healthiest, most environmentally sustainable and
supply-chain stable meat for dogs and cats. BioCraft is located in both
North America and Europe, with R&D performed via its subsidiary company,
BioCraft Pet Nutrition GmbH in Austria. BioCraft investors include
Draper Associates, SOSV, KEEN Growth Capital, Orkla Food Ingredients,
Sentient Investment, Hack Capital and angel investors. BioCraft Pet
Nutrition GmbH is a recipient of grant funding from the Austrian
Research Promotion Agency (FFG). For more information visit
