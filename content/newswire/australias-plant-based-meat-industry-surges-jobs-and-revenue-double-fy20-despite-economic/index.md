Despite COVID restrictions and lockdowns, consumer demand for
plant-based meat products in Australia -- such as meat-free burgers,
sausages and ready meals -- grew exponentially last year, according to a
new report out today with modelling by Deloitte Access Economics.

Retail sales surged 46 percent in the year to June 2020, with the number
of new jobs more than doubling (106 percent growth) in the emerging
sector, and manufacturing revenues increasing from \$35 million to
nearly \$70 million.

The report by Food Frontier, Australia's independent think tank on
alternative proteins, further reveals that national retailers doubled
the number of plant-based meat products on Australian grocery shelves
last year to more than 200. This expansion of plant-based meat product
ranges caters to growing consumer interest, as evidenced by the
one-third of Australians who are limiting their meat consumption.i

Growing demand for meat alternatives being driven foremost by health
concerns, which the report notes are expected to rise further
post-pandemic.ii

At the same time, global investment in plant-based meat in 2020
reflected this rising demand, with US\$1.5 billion pouring in from
international meat and FMCG giants, governments and venture capitalists.

Deloitte Access Economics' 2019 modelling for Food Frontier forecast
that consumer sales in Australia's plant-based meat sector could hit \$3
billion annually by 2030, from its FY20 level of \$185 million -- and
create over 6,000 new jobs.

But Food Frontier CEO Thomas King says governments at all levels need to
support investment in R&D and infrastructure for the burgeoning
industry, as well as evidenced-based regulation to ensure a level
playing field for new players in the market.

"With the right political will, Australia can build a
multi-billion-dollar plant-based meat industry, enabling our food
businesses and farmers to capitalise on fast-growing global demand for
alternative proteins."

Plant-based meats are forecast to command 10 percent of the US\$1.4
trillion global meat market by 2029 according to Barclays,iii as the
growing category of consumers dubbed 'flexitarians' choose meat
alternatives more often.

According to recent reports, much of that growth will be in Asia --
where consumer demand for alternatives like plant-based mince,
poultry-style and pork-style products is expected to grow 200 percent
over the next five years in China and Thailand alone.iv

"Australia's plant-based meat companies are eyeing export opportunities
and will be watching demand trends overseas closely, while some,
including Fable Food Co, Fenn Foods and v2food, have already launched
into Singapore, Japan, Korea and other Asian markets," said King.

"Australia has the agricultural capacity, commercial appetite and
research know-how to become an international leader in new protein
industries including plant-based meat. To not make the early investments
necessary to leverage these unique strengths would be a
missed opportunity."

**Additional points from Food Frontier's 2020 State of the
Industry report:**

-   The number of Australian plant-based meat brands almost doubled from
    10 to 19 in major retail and national foodservice outlets
    (supermarkets, restaurants and fast-food outlets) in FY20.
-   Amidst the pandemic, Australian plant-based meat companies pivoted
    where necessary to achieve expansion plans. For example, amid dining
    closures Fable Food Co and v2food transitioned to home meal delivery
    through partnerships with local restaurants and Deliveroo,
    respectively; v2food paired deliveries with trial packs of its
    retail products.
-   Australian foodservice sales were down 10 per cent due to the
    pandemic, including sales of plant-based meat. Given new plant-based
    meat products were introduced to menus just before pandemic-induced
    lockdowns, this sales channel has potential for considerable growth
    in 2021 and beyond.

**The opportunity for Australia**\
Sector-wide interventions that will enable the plant-based meat sector
to continue its upward trajectory, benefiting consumers, food businesses
and crop farmers:

-   State governments can bring jobs to their region and enable
    Australian farmers to generate more profit at the farmgate by
    supporting investments in the infrastructure necessary to process
    Australian crops into the ingredients used in plant-based meats.
-   Federal government can support R&D that generates plant protein
    intellectual property, which will help to establish Australia as a
    global centre for alternative proteins and contribute to the
    nation's goal of a \$100 billion food and fibre sector by 2030.
-   Retailers can further growth in the plant-based meat category by
    supplying options that satisfy consumer tastes at more competitive
    prices and providing promotional support.
