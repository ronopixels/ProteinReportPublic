There's a very clear call for the plant-based sector to come together in
order to accelerate change for a healthy and sustainable future,
delegates heard at the most recent Bridge2Food
[summit](https://bridge2food.com/webinars/summit-plant-based-foods-proteins-americas-2021/info/programme/).

"Leaders from across the value chain are urgently calling for action
towards the protein transition to plant-based foods if we are to make a
difference for planetary health: it is about transformation, cross
value-chain impact, and getting more decision-makers at the table," says
CEO Gerard Klein Essink.

In a
[panel](https://bridge2food.com/moonshot-2030-plant-based-proteins-key-to-sustainable-future/)
about what is needed to make the transition to more plant-based foods
and who is going to get us there, five senior leaders agreed innovative,
integrated efforts will be required.

"We need to have people from around the world in the room," said Sara
Eckhouse, executive director of FoodShot during the discussion.

The need for greater collaboration is key for driving change all along
the value chain and that theme was emphasized at virtually every
session.

"Ecosystems are thriving and people are working collectively across
geographical or other boundaries. The food industry is behind other
sectors in learning to work collaboratively and strategically but that
is changing --- fast," says Klein Essink.

Ecosystems are exciting right now as working together is what will help
solve larger scale problems such as climate change, said Scott May, head
of innovation platform MISTA in a [panel
discussion](https://bridge2food.com/how-do-you-build-an-ecosystem-3-creators-talk-you-through-it/)
about how to build ecosystems.

"This is what is going to get us across the line in solving some of
these big challenges," said May.

People are demanding more information about how their food choices
affect the environment.

"Consumers want to understand more about what they are buying from the
sustainability standpoint, especially food products," Steve Savell,
directory of external affairs & sustainability with Bush Brothers, told
a [sustainability
panel](https://bridge2food.com/good-data-key-to-give-consumers-the-information-they-want-about-sustainable-food-choices/).

The key to providing eco-certified products is first good, reliable data
that is useful to the food system and those projects are underway.

"We need the whole spectrum involved," said Savell. "The idea is for us
to come together and do it collectively."

Over three days Sept. 27-29 about 400 delegates, 14 speakers, 27
panelists and 18 startups gathered virtually to look at ways to further
advance the plant-based industry.
