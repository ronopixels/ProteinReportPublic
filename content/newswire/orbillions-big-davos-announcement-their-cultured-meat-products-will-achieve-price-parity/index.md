(San Francisco, California) - Orbillion's cell-cultured meats will reach
price parity in 2026, and commodity pricing for beef in 2030. The recent
announcement comes just days before CEO and Co-Founder, Patricia Bubner,
PhD, will present in Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum
(WEF) is holding its annual meeting. Bubner will share how they plan to
democratize access to delicious and healthful cell-cultured meat to help
address food insecurity.

Orbillion splashed on the scene with their first public tasting in which
they showcased 3 different delicious meats (pre-regulatory approval).
The real kicker? It was after only four months of development, proving
that the team at Orbillion has the requisite technical expertise and can
move fast, in fact 18x faster and 10x cheaper than other cell-cultured
meat companies.

Since graduating from the esteemed accelerator YCombinator in 2021,
Orbillion has continued to expand its leadership team and advisory
board. Most recently Orbillion welcomed Greg Hiller, a globally
recognized industry leader in cell culture and bioprocessing innovation,
as an Advisor.

"I'm very excited to join the Orbillion team as an Advisor to help push
the frontier of what's possible for cultured meat. I'm hopeful that my
skill set of innovative process development methods will further
facilitate the development of a highly intensified cell culture process
that will make cultured meat scalable, and as a result, accessible to
all," shared Hiller.

To date the Orbillion team has raised \$9.5 million to blend
breakthrough science, heritage breeds, and culinary artistry; their
first product will be cell-cultured, Japanese bred, Wagyu beef.

"I believe that the future of food will involve making delicious food
more sustainable and more accessible. The Orbillion team of culinary
innovators has the technical chops to deliver on the promise of
cell-cultured meat, and to create high-quality products that eaters will
love." said Orbillion Investor and Instacart CEO, Fidji Simo.

As Orbillion turns its sights to launching a product in the market,
pending regulatory approvals, access is top of mind. With food prices
and food security straining under geopolitical issues and a changing
climate, consumers and farmers will only continue to bear the burden.
Given the urgency and scale of these issues, Orbillion believes all
solutions must be on the table.

"We are advocates of a wide range of solutions that can help make our
food system more sustainable, nutritious, and reliable, and we see
cell-cultured meat and alt proteins as an important \"and\" solution to
regenerative agriculture. We all must work together," said Bubner.
"Realizing the potential of cell-cultured meat means making it
accessible. We know from extensive consumer and foodservice research
around the globe, that price is key to making that happen. I'm so proud
of the team that in less than one year, we've reduced the cost of
production by 98%. Very eager for what's ahead."

Bubner and her Co-Founders, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS, and Gabriel
Levesque-Tremblay, PhD, were invited to present in Davos during this
year's WEF annual meeting. Bubner will speak at the Green Accelerator
event and Orbillion will attend several other events with government
officials and industry leaders, to discuss how cell-cultured meat can
support food independence.

**About Orbillion:**\
[Orbillion Bio](https://www.orbillion.com/) will be the first company to
bring cell-cultured beef to market. By producing delicious, healthful,
safe meat without raising animals, Orbillion will replace factory farmed
beef with an alternative meat eaters will love. They developed key
technologies to scale cultured meat up --- developing four different
flavorful meats 18x faster and 10x cheaper than competitors. At their
pre-regulatory approval tasting event, food experts praised the flavor
and texture of their first products
([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57Ku7T_kY6M&ab_channel=PatriciaBubner)).
Orbillion technology requires significantly less land and water
resources, making high quality protein production more resilient to the
effects of a changing climate. Getting there means bringing consumers on
board, that's why they're forging a clear path to cost reduction and
will be among the first companies to file for US regulatory approval.
