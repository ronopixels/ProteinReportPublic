*Tel Aviv, July 25, 2023 ***-- **[Brevel](https://brevel.co.il/), the
leading microalgae-based alternative protein company, announced today it
has completed its seed funding round of \$18.5M. The funds raised will
be used to provide an alternative protein that is neutral-tasting,
functional, highly sustainable and affordable to the mainstream food
industry. The round was led by NevaTeam Partners and supported by the
European Union's EIC Fund, as well as other leading food and climate
funds and strategic partners from within the food industry. 

Brevel\'s technology is the first in the world to combine sugar-based
fermentation of microalgae with high light concentrations at industrial
scales to produce a protein that will be incorporated by food
manufacturers into plant-based products. This technological breakthrough
tackles the primary barriers to market penetration for new protein
sources: **taste, functionality, and cost**, creating the most suitable
protein for the plant-based industry. As a result, Brevel's proteins are
increasingly in demand by food manufacturers for a wide variety of
applications, and will enable the development of healthier, tastier and
environmentally friendly non-animal food products.

The company is primarily targeting the dairy alternative sector, which
faces a significant challenge in protein content. Other plant-based
protein sources such as soy are allergenic and often have overpowering
flavors, making them less efficient for use in plant-based milk and
cheese products. In contrast, Brevel\'s protein can be seamlessly
incorporated, significantly boosting nutritional value and enhancing
texture without compromising on taste, color, or cost.

Brevel is achieving cost parity with traditional plant-based protein
sources such as pea and soy by utilizing its unique technology to
generate valuable co-products alongside the high concentration of
functional protein from microalgae such as functional lipids, pigments
and more. This approach enables Brevel to attain almost triple the
profitability from the same microalgae, making it feasible to price the
protein competitively in the market.

Brevel's process causes the smallest environmental footprint possible
and is unaffected by weather conditions, climate change and seasonal
variations. It does not require arable land, can recycle 100% of the
water, use on-site clean energy and feed the world with a fraction of
the land used today for traditional agriculture. Brevel has been
operating their large-scale 500 liter pilot in Israel and will very soon
move into their first of commercial-scale factory with the
first-of-its-kind 5000 liter fermentation and light system. All of
Brevel's manufacturing systems have been designed and built by Brevel,
as well as the development of all the biological processes.

"This substantial funding round will fuel Brevel's journey forward and
pave the way for our vision of sustainable nutrition for the future of
our planet to materialize," says Yonatan Golan, CEO and Co-Founder of
Brevel. "We are primed and ready for our next major leap -- the global
scale production of Brevel\'s protein that will be integrated into
healthier, tastier and environmentally-friendly food products in every
household".

"Having followed Brevel's impressive developments and achievements in
recent years, we believe that Brevel will be one of the leading
companies in the global alternative protein industry and we are excited
to join their journey towards that goal,\" Said Shai Levy, Managing
Partner at NevaTeam Partners, who will also be joining Brevel's board.
"We believe that Brevel's innovative technology enables the
cost-efficient production of high-quality protein extracted from
microalgae, which is crucial for the future of sustainable food
production."

"We identified Brevel as an ambitious company with breakthrough
technology which can provide significant impact. After the Horizon 2020
non-dilutive grant, the EIC Fund made the decision to further support
and join Brevel with an equity investment in their** **journey towards a
sustainable future." says Svetoslava Georgieva, Chair of the EIC Fund
Board.

Brevel\'s seed funding totals \$18.5M, including \$8.4M converted from
grants and convertible loans into shares.

**About Brevel**

Brevel provides alternative protein which is tasty, sustainable,
functional and affordable.

They do this from microalgae in a unique proprietary technology which
for the first time combines fermentation and light in industrial scale
systems, thus creating a protein which is the most sustainable on
earth, flavor and color neutral, highly functional, suitable to be
incorporated into a large variety of food applications and for the first
time at cost parity with traditional plant-based sources such as pea and
soy.

The company is scaling its manufacturing capacity with the first of its
kind commercial factory in Israel and preparing for the construction of
an additional much larger facility with a total capacity of 900,000L
planned for 2025. Brevel is piloting with a variety of food
manufacturers worldwide to develop plant based food applications with
Brevel's protein. The first products incorporating Brevel's protein
inside are expected to be on shelves during 2024. Brevel was founded by
three brothers Yonatan (CEO), Matan (COO) and Ido (CTO) Golan.

**About EIC Fund **

The European Innovation Council Fund from the European Commission
invests across all technologies and verticals, and all EU countries and
countries associated with Horizon Europe. It provides the investment
