San Francisco, CA, December 17, 2020  --- TurtleTree Labs, the biotech
company pioneering the method to produce milk using cell-based
technology, has just announced the close of an oversubscribed \$6.2
million Pre-A funding round from new and existing global investors
including Green Monday Ventures, Eat Beyond Global, KBW Ventures, and
Verso Capital.

TurtleTree Labs, which has offices in San Francisco and Singapore, will
use the funds to accelerate research and production of functional,
bioactive proteins and complex sugars found in human milk. These
high-value components have potential benefits in gut and brain health,
which can be applied to both infant and senior nutrition.

"The vision of TurtleTree Labs is to create a truly sustainable and
cruelty-free food system," adds Max Rye, Chief Strategist of TurtleTree
Labs. "We are grateful to have the support of leading investors from
every corner of the world."  

The company also announced that HRH Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal
Al Saud, a prominent global investor in the alternative protein sector
through KBW Ventures, will join TurtleTree Labs as an Advisor. KBW
Ventures first invested in the TurtleTree Labs seed round announced in
June 2020 and has committed additional capital to the latest round, the
Pre-A raise.

In his role as Advisor, Prince Khaled will shape new market growth
plans, lend his expertise in the alternative protein and food tech
spheres, and liaise closely with the founding team on other areas of the
business. 

"TurtleTree Labs' groundbreaking technology, which allowed our company
to win The Liveability Challenge and Entrepreneurship World Cup, has
certainly attracted interest from a global and diverse panel of
investors and customers," says Fengru Lin, CEO of TurtleTree Labs.

"TurtleTree Labs' technology is able to significantly reduce our carbon
footprint and address food resilience in the long term. This is a
win-win for our planet and for communities. We are happy that The
Liveability Challenge is able to showcase sustainable ideas and
innovations from around the world, and support winners like TurtleTree
Labs and other innovators to secure funding and opportunities to further
develop their solutions," said Mr Lim Hock Chuan, Chief Executive,
Temasek Foundation Ecosperity.

"TurtleTree Labs represents the spirit and impact of the
Entrepreneurship World Cup where they emerged from a pool of 175,000
registrants from 200 countries," adds Ana Maria Torres, Director for the
Entrepreneurship World Cup. "This investment --- and the continued
support it will receive from a global network of ecosystem leaders ---
provides them with an opportunity to scale in a rapidly-changing
industry while addressing an extensive global need."
