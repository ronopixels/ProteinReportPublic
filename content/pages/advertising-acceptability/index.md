Protein Report reserves the right to accept or decline any advertisement or sponsorship it is offered.

Protein Report will decline to accept advertising that it knows or believes to be misleading, inaccurate, fraudulent or illegal, or that fails to comply, in Protein Report’s sole discretion, with its standards of decency, taste, or dignity.

Protein Report, like all quality publishers of original journalism, maintains a clear separation between news and advertising content. Advertising that attempts to blur this distinction in a manner that, in Protein Report’s sole judgment, confuses or misleads readers will be rejected or clearly marked as sponsored content.
