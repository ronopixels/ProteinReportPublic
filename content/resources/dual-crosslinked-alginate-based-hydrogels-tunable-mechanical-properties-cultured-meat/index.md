Cultured meat refers to the production of animal tissue by utilizing the
same techniques as tissue engineering through cell culture. Various
biomaterials have been designed to serve as in vitro supports for cell
viability, growth, and migration. In this study, visible light and
dual-crosslinked alginate hydrogels were designed to enable control of
the physical and mechanical properties needed for the fabrication of
cultured meat scaffolds. We hypothesized that a difference in hydrogel
stiffness would influence cell behavior, indicating the efficacy of our
processing methods to benefit the cultured meat field. Herein, we
synthesized and created: (1) methacrylated alginate (AlgMA) to enable
covalent crosslinking via visible light exposure, (2) Methacrylated
alginate and arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid [RGD]{.caps} conjugates
(AlgMA-[RGD]{.caps}), using carbodiimide chemistries to provide
cell-binding sites on the material, and (3) designer hydrogels
incorporating different crosslinking techniques. The material and
mechanical properties were evaluated to determine the structural
integrity of the hydrogels, and in vitro cell assays were conducted to
verify cytocompatibility and cell adhesion. Gelation, swell ratio, and
weight loss calculations revealed longer gelation times for the AlgMA
scaffolds and similar physical properties for all hydrogel groups. We
showed that by adjusting the polymer concentration and the crosslinking
methodology, the scaffold's mechanical properties can be controlled and
optimized within physiological ranges. Incorporating dual crosslinking
significantly increased the compressive moduli of the AlgMA hydrogels,
compared to visible-light crosslinking alone. Moreover, the muscle
satellite cells responded favorably to the AlgMA scaffolds, with clear
differences in cell density when cultured on materials with
significantly different mechanical properties. Our results indicate the
usefulness of the dual-crosslinking alginate hydrogel system to support
in vitro meatÂ growth.
