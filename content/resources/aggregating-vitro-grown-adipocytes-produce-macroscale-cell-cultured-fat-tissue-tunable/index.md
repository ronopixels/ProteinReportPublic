description: "We present a method of producing bulk cell-cultured fat tissue for food applications. Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat tissue is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D constructs using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fat tissues were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests."

We present a method of producing bulk cell-cultured fat tissue for food
applications. Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste
diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially
culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat
tissue is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the
lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D constructs using alginate or
transglutaminase binders. The 3D fat tissues were visually similar to
fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on
uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical properties of cultured fat
tissues were based on binder choice and concentration, and changes in
the fatty acid compositions of cellular triacylglyceride and
phospholipids were observed after lipid supplementation (soybean oil)
during in vitro culture. This approach of aggregating individual
adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a scalable and versatile
strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for food-related applications,
thereby addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meatÂ production.
