description: "Food’s environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts."

Food's environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse
producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this
heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental
indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and
retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product,
creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is
complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low
impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have
limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of
the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable
substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary
change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers
monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by
choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts
to consumers.
