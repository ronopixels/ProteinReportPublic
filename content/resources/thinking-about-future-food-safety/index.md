Agrifood systems are undergoing a transformation with the aim to provide
safer, more affordable, and healthier diets for all, produced in a
sustainable manner while delivering just and equitable livelihoods: a
key to achieving the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
However, this transformation needs to be executed in the global context
of major challenges facing the food and agriculture sectors, with
drivers such as climate change, population growth, urbanization, and
natural resources depletion compounding these challenges.

Food safety is a keystone to agrifood systems and all food safety actors
need to keep pace with the ongoing transformation while preparing to
navigate the potential threats, disruptions, and challenges that may
arise. Foresight in food safety facilitates the proactive identification
of drivers and related trends, both within and outside agrifood systems,
that have implications for food safety and therefore also for consumer
health, the national economy, and international trade. Early
identification and evaluation of drivers and trends promote strategic
planning and preparedness to take advantage of emerging opportunities
and address challenges in food safety.

In this publication, the FAO Food Safety Foresight programme provides an
overview of the major global drivers and trends by describing their
implications for food safety in particular and for agrifood systems by
extrapolation. The various drivers and trends reported include climate
change, changing consumer behaviour and preferences, new food sources
and production systems, technological advances, microbiome, circular
economy, food fraud, among others.

The intended audience for this publication is broad -- from the
policymakers, academia, food business operators, private sector, to all
of us, the consumers.
