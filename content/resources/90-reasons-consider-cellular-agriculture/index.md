Farming animals for products like meat, dairy, and leather have been
common globally for over 9,000 years. While animal products have been
incredibly positive for society over multiple generations, today they
are proving more destructive than beneficial with the rise of factory
farming. After thousands of years depending on animals for agriculture,
humanity has finally attained the biotechnological means to supersede
this necessity through a new practice called cellular agriculture. This
concept of farming identical animal products from cells outside of an
animal, without the need for raising a living animal, poses a
much-needed solution to factory farming. Cell-ag has the potential to
address problems of public health, the environment, and human/animal
rights at a remarkable scale, positioning it in an unprecedented class
truly capable of revolutionizing the world. Whether you approach this
piece as a skeptic, supporter, or potential consumer, the following is a
non-exhaustive list outlining 90 reasons to consider
cellularÂ agriculture.
