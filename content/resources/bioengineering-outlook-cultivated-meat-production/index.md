Cultured meat (also referred to as cultivated meat or cell-based
meat)---[CM]{.caps}---is fabricated through the process of cellular
agriculture ([CA]{.caps}), which entails application of bioengineering,
i.e., tissue engineering ([TE]{.caps}) principles to the production of
food. The main [TE]{.caps} principles include usage of cells, grown in a
controlled environment provided by bioreactors and cultivation media
supplemented with growth factors and other needed nutrients and
signaling molecules, and seeded onto the immobilization
elements---microcarriers and scaffolds that provide the adhesion
surfaces necessary for anchor-dependent cells and offer 3D organization
for multiple cell types. Theoretically, many solutions from regenerative
medicine and biomedical engineering can be applied in
[CM]{.caps}-[TE]{.caps}, i.e., [CA]{.caps}. However, in practice, there
are a number of specificities regarding fabrication of a [CM]{.caps}
product that needs to fulfill not only the majority of functional
criteria of muscle and fat [TE]{.caps}, but also has to possess the
sensory and nutritional qualities of a traditional food component, i.e.,
the meat it aims to replace. This is the reason that bioengineering
aimed at [CM]{.caps} production needs to be regarded as a specific
scientific discipline of a multidisciplinary nature, integrating
principles from biomedical engineering as well as from food
manufacturing, design and development, i.e., food engineering. An
important requirement is also the need to use as little as possible of
animal-derived components in the whole [CM]{.caps} bioprocess. In this
review, we aim to present the current knowledge on different
bioengineering aspects, pertinent to different current scientific
disciplines but all relevant for [CM]{.caps} engineering, relevant for
muscle [TE]{.caps}, including different cell sources, bioreactor types,
media requirements, bioprocess monitoring and kinetics and their
modifications for use in [CA]{.caps}, all in view of their potential for
efficient [CM]{.caps} bioprocess scale-up. We believe such a review will
offer a good overview of different bioengineering strategies for
[CM]{.caps} production and will be useful to a range of interested
stakeholders, from students just entering the [CA]{.caps} field to
experienced researchers looking for the latest innovations in the field.
