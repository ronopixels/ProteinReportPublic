The development of cost-effective serum-free media is essential for the
economic viability of cultured meat. A key challenge facing this goal is
high-cost recombinant albumin that is necessary in some available
serum-free media formulations. As such, there is substantial interest in
finding albumin alternatives which are low-cost, effective, scalable,
sustainable, and suitable for food applications. Recently, a serum-free
medium termed Beefy-9 was developed for bovine satellite cells
([BSC]{.caps}s), which relied on recombinant albumin as a key component
to replace fetal bovine serum. Here we alter Beefy-9 by replacing
albumin with rapeseed protein isolate, a bulk-protein solution obtained
from agricultural waste-streams through simple isoelectric protein
precipitation. This new medium, termed Beefy-R, improves [BSC]{.caps}
growth compared with Beefy-9 while maintaining cell phenotype and
myogenicity. These results offer an effective, low-cost, and sustainable
alternative to albumin for serum-free culture of muscle stem cells,
thereby addressing a key hurdle facing cultured meatÂ production.
