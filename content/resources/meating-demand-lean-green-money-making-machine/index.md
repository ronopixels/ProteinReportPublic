Global meat market revenues are expected to almost double over the next
20 years; however, its growth looks set to be driven by the plant- and
cell-based meat subsectors. Plant-based products should dominate the
meat alternatives space over the next five years, where innovation is
creating a credible consumer proposition. Products can now mimic the
sensory profile of conventional meat, where tastes and textures offer a
meat-like experience. Kearney estimates that revenue for the global
plant-based meat market is projected to grow from [US]{.caps}\$46bn to
[US]{.caps}\$120bn between 2018 and 2025, representing a 15%
[CAGR]{.caps}. Longer-term growth projections vary greatly, with revenue
estimates for the global market in 2030 ranging from \$140bn (Barclays)
to \$252bn (Kearney). The number of companies entering the market is
proliferating, including a number of large multinationals that can
support significant [R&D]{.caps} investment. That said, the plant-based
meat market is still in its infancy and faces several headwinds,
including the threat of competition and regulatory scrutiny.
