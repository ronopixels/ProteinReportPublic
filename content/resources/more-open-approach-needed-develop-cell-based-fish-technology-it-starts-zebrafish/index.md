The global demand for fish is rising and projected to increase for years
to come. However, there is uncertainty whether this increased demand can
be met by the conventional approaches of capture fisheries and fish
farming because of wild stock depletion, natural resource requirements,
and environmental impact concerns. One proposed complementary solution
is to manufacture the same meat directly from fish cells, as cell-based
fish. More than 30 ventures are competing to commercialize cell-based
meat broadly, but the field lacks a foundation of shared scientific
knowledge, which threatens to delay progress. Here, we recommend taking
a research-focused, more open and collaborative approach to cell-based
fish meat development that targets lean fish and an unlikely but very
attractive candidate for accelerating research and development, the
zebrafish. Although substantial work lies ahead, cell-based meat
technology could prove to be a more efficient, less resource-intensive
method of producing lean fish meat.
