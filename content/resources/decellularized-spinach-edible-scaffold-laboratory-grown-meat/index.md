description: "It is projected that by the year 2050, there will be insufficient land suitable for agriculture to feed the world. Cellular agriculture has the potential to produce meat that replicates the structure of traditionally produced meat while minimizing the land needed. There is a need for an edible scaffold suitable for the growth of animal muscle. This study showed that decellularizing spinach leaves produced an edible scaffold that has a vascular network that could potentially maintain the viability of primary bovine satellite cells as they develop into meat."

It is projected that by the year 2050, there will be insufficient land
suitable for agriculture to feed the world. Cellular agriculture has the
potential to produce meat that replicates the structure of traditionally
produced meat while minimizing the land needed. There is a need for an
edible scaffold suitable for the growth of animal muscle. This study
showed that decellularizing spinach leaves produced an edible scaffold
that has a vascular network that could potentially maintain the
viability of primary bovine satellite cells as they develop into meat.
Primary bovine satellite cells were cultured on the surface of
decellularized spinach leaves and gelatin coated glass for 7 and 14
days. After 14 days, primary bovine satellite cells seeded on the
decellularized leaf scaffold maintained \~99% viability; and \~25% of
the cells showed expression of myosin heavy-chain. Cell alignment varied
between animals from which the cells were acquired. Areas of alignment
were observed showing an average kappa value for cytoskeletal alignment
of 0.71 ± 0.1 after 14 days in culture. There was no statistical
significance in each category between cells cultured on gelatin coated
glass and decellularized spinach leaves. These results suggested that
decellularized spinach is a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly
scaffold, that can potentially accelerate the development of
laboratory-grown meat by providing an edible substrate for bovine
satellite cells.
