Lab-grown bovine meat analogues are emerging alternatives to animal
sacrifices for cultured meat production. The most challenging aspect of
the production process is the rapid proliferation of cells and
establishment of the desired 3D structure for mass production. In this
study, we developed a direct ink writing-based 3D-bioprinted meat
culture platform composed of 6% (w/v) alginate and 4% (w/v) gelatin
(Alg/Gel)-based hydrogel scaffolds supplemented with naturally derived
protein hydrolysates (PHs; 10%) from highly nutritive plants (soybean,
pigeon pea, and wheat), and some selected edible insects (beetles,
crickets, and mealworms) on in vitro proliferation of bovine
myosatellite cells (bMSCs) extracted from fresh meat samples. The
developed bioink exhibited excellent shear-thinning behavior (*n* \< 1)
and mechanical stability during 3D bioprinting. Commercial proteases
(Alcalase, Neutrase, and Flavourzyme) were used for protein hydrolysis.
The resulting hydrolysates exhibited lower-molecular-weight bands
(12--50 kDa) than those of crude isolates (55--160 kDa), as determined
by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The degree
of hydrolysis was higher in the presence of Alcalase for both plant
(34%) and insect (62%) PHs than other enzymes. The 3D-printed hydrogel
scaffolds displayed excellent bioactivity and stability after 7 days of
incubation. The developed prototype structure (pepperoni meat, 20 × 20 ×
5 mm) provided a highly stable, nutritious, and mechanically strong
structure that supported the rapid proliferation of myoblasts in a
low-serum environment during the entire culture period. The
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay enhanced the free
radical reduction of Alcalase- and Neutrase-treated PHs. Furthermore,
the bioprinted bMSCs displayed early myogenesis (desmin and Pax7) in the
presence of PHs, suggesting its role in bMSC differentiation. In
conclusion, we developed a 3D bioprinted and bioactive meat culture
platform using Alg/Gel/PHs as a printable and edible component for the
mass production of cultured meat.
