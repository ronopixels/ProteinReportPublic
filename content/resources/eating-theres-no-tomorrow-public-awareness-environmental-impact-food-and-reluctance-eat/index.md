Reducing meat consumption is central to many of the scientific debates
on healthy, sustainable diets because of the high environmental impact
of meat production. Missing from these debates are the public
perspectives about eating less meat and consideration of cultural and
social values associated with meat. The aim of this study was to explore
public awareness of the environmental impact of food and their
willingness to reduce meat consumption. Twelve focus groups and four
individual interviews were conducted with adults from a range of
socio-economic groups living in both rural and urban settings in
Scotland. Public understanding of the link between food, environment and
climate change was explored, with a focus on meat and attitudes towards
reducing meat consumption. Data were transcribed and analysed
thematically. Three dominant themes emerged: a lack of awareness of the
association between meat consumption and climate change, perceptions of
personal meat consumption playing a minimal role in the global context
of climate change, and resistance to the idea of reducing personal meat
consumption. People associated eating meat with pleasure, and described
social, personal and cultural values around eating meat. Some people
felt they did not need to eat less meat because they had already reduced
their consumption or that they only ate small quantities. Scepticism of
scientific evidence linking meat and climate change was common. Changing
non-food related behaviours was viewed as more acceptable and a greater
priority for climate change mitigation. The study highlights the role
meat plays in the diet for many people, beyond nutritional needs. If
healthy, sustainable dietary habits are to be achieved, cultural, social
and personal values around eating meat must be integrated into the
development of future dietaryÂ recommendations.
