Great importance is being given to the impact our food supply chain and
consumers' food habits are having on the environment, human health, and
animal welfare. One of the latest developments aiming at positively
changing the food ecosystem is represented by cultured meat. This form
of cellular agriculture has the objective to generate slaughter-free
meat products starting from the cultivation of few cells harvested from
the animal tissue of interest. As a consequence, a large number of cells
has to be generated at a reasonable cost. Just to give an idea of the
scale, there were billions of cells just in a bite of the first
cultured-meat burger. Thus, one of the major challenges faced by the
scientists involved in this new ambitious and fascinating field, is how
to efficiently scale-up cell manufacture. Considering the great
potential presented by cultured meat, audiences from different
backgrounds are very interested in this topic and eager to be informed
of the challenges and possible solutions in this area. In light of this,
we will provide an overview of the main existing bioprocessing
technologies used to scale-up adherent cells at a small and large scale.
Thus, giving a brief technical description of these bioprocesses, with
the main associated advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we will
introduce an alternative solution we believe has the potential to
revolutionize the way adherent cells are grown, helping cultured meat
become a reality.
