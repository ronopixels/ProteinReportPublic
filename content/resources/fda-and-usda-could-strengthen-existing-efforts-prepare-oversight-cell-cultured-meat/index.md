## What GAO Found

General information about the process of making cell-cultured
meat---food products grown from the cells of livestock, poultry, and
seafood---is available. However, no company is commercially producing
cell-cultured meat. Specific information about the technology being
used, eventual commercial production methods, and composition of the
final products is not yet known. The general process contains five
phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing (see
figure). The technology and methods to be used for commercial production
are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do
not have clarity about many specifics about the process and final
product. For example, it is unclear whether production methods and
products will use or contain genetically-engineered cells or medications
such as antibiotics.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) have begun collaborating on regulatory oversight of
cell-cultured meat. For example, in 2019, the agencies signed an
interagency agreement and created three working groups to carry out the
terms of the agreement. However, the agreement and working groups could
more fully incorporate practices to enhance and sustain collaboration,
such as defining outcomes. For example, the agreement identifies the
development of labeling principles as an outcome, but does not describe
how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward this outcome,
and the working groups identify a lead agency but not members\' roles.
Also, agency officials said they decided FDA would oversee cell-cultured
seafood other than catfish, but they have not formally announced or
documented this decision. Developing and updating written guidance and
agreements is also a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By
fully incorporating leading practices into their efforts to collaborate,
the agencies could minimize potential overlap and fragmentation, use
resources in a more efficient manner, and better ensure the public and
other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies\' oversight
responsibilities.

## Why GAO Did This Study

Multiple firms have produced cell-cultured meat as part of their
research and development. These products appear likely to become
available to consumers in coming years. FDA and USDA are the primary
agencies responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation\'s food
supply. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the
agencies\' oversight of cell-cultured meat amidst a fragmented federal
food safety oversight system.

GAO was asked to review federal oversight of cell-cultured meat. This
report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially
producing cell-cultured meat, and (2) examines the extent to which FDA
and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of
cell-cultured meat. GAO conducted a literature review; reviewed
documentation from FDA, USDA, and stakeholder groups; analyzed public
comments submitted to the agencies; compared agency efforts with leading
practices for interagency collaboration; and conducted site visits to
selected cell-cultured meat firms.

## What GAO Recommends

GAO recommends that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading
practices for effective collaboration in the agencies\' interagency
agreement. FDA and USDA partially concurred and indicated a willingness
to incorporate these practices in a more detailed agreement, which would
also meet the intent of the recommendations. The agencies concurred with
the four other recommendations.
