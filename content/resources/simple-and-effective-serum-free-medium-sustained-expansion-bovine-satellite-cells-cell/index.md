Cell-cultured meat offers the potential for a more sustainable, ethical,
resilient, and healthy food system. However, research and development
has been hindered by the lack of suitable serum-free media that enable
the robust expansion of relevant cells (e.g., muscle satellite cells)
over multiple passages. Recently, a low-cost serum-free media
([B8]{.caps}) was described for induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we
adapt this media for bovine satellite cells and show that the addition
of a single component, recombinant albumin, renders [B8]{.caps} suitable
for the long-term expansion of cells without sacrificing myogenicity. We
show that this new media (Beefy-9) maintains robust cell growth over the
entire culture period tested (seven passages) with an average growth
rate of 39 hours per population doubling). Along with demonstrated
efficacy for bovine cells, this work provides a promising starting-point
for developing serum-free media for cultures from other meat-relevant
species. Ultimately, this work offers a promising foundation for
escaping the reliance on serum in cultured meat research, thereby
accelerating theÂ field.
