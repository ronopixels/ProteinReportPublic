This report aims to assess the full impact of the livestock sector on
environmental problems, along with potential technical and policy
approaches to mitigation. The assessment is based on the most recent and
complete data available, taking into account direct impacts, along with
the impacts of feedcrop agriculture required for livestock production.

The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most
significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at
every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest
that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of
land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and
water pollution and loss of biodiversity. 

Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale
and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The
impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency.
Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.
