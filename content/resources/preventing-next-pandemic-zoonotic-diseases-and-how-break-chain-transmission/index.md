Most of these consider the important questions of how to respond to the ongoing public health crisis, or how to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. This report takes a step back and considers the root causes of the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus and other ‘zoonoses’—diseases that are transmitted between animals and humans.

In this time of crisis, thousands of papers and guidelines have already
been published about COVID-19. Most of these consider the important
questions of how to respond to the ongoing public health crisis, or how
to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. This report takes a step back
and considers the root causes of the emergence and spread of the novel
coronavirus and other 'zoonoses'---diseases that are transmitted between
animals and humans. The report also offers a set of practical
recommendations that can help policymakers prevent and respond to future
disease outbreaks.
