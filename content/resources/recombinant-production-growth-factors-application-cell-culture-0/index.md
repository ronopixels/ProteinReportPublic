Culturing eukaryotic cells has widespread applications in research and
industry, including the emerging field of cell-cultured meat production
colloquially referred to as "cellular agriculture". These applications
are often restricted by the high cost of growth medium necessary for
cell growth. Mitogenic protein growth factors (GFs) are essential
components of growth medium and account for upwards of 90% of the total
costs. Here, we present a set of expression constructs and a simplified
protocol for recombinant production of functionally active GFs,
including FGF2, IGF1, PDGF-BB, and TGF-β1 in *Escherichia coli*. Using
this *E. coli* expression system, we produced soluble GF orthologs from
species including bovine, chicken, and salmon. Bioactivity analysis
revealed orthologs with improved performance compared to commercially
available alternatives. We estimated that the production cost of GFs
using our methodology will significantly reduce the cost of cell culture
medium, facilitating low-cost protocols tailored for cultured meat
production and tissue engineering.
