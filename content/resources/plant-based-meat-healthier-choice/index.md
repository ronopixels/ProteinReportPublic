*Plant-Based Meat: A Healthier Choice?*is a collaboration between Food
Frontier, Australia and New Zealand's not-for-profit think tank on
alternative proteins, and Teri Lichtenstein, a leading Australian
Accredited Practising Dietitian. It compares the nutritional averages of
plant-based meat categories to similarly processed, conventional meats,
from sausages and burgers to chicken-style pieces and more. It further
explores other health impacts of plant-based meats, from processing to
ingredients, as well as the individual and public health risks
associated with high production and intake of conventional meat.
