description: "The current process of meat production using livestock has significant effects on the global environment, including high emissions of greenhouse gases. In recent years, cultured meat has attracted attention as a way to acquire animal proteins. However, the lack of markers that isolate proliferating cells from bovine tissues and the complex structure of the meat make it difficult to culture meat in a dish. In this study, we screened 246 cell-surface antibodies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for their capacity to form colonies and their suitability to construct spheroid “meat buds”."

The current process of meat production using livestock has significant
effects on the global environment, including high emissions of
greenhouse gases. In recent years, cultured meat has attracted attention
as a way to acquire animal proteins. However, the lack of markers that
isolate proliferating cells from bovine tissues and the complex
structure of the meat make it difficult to culture meat in a dish. In
this study, we screened 246 cell-surface antibodies by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting for their capacity to form colonies
and their suitability to construct spheroid "meat buds". [CD29]{.caps}+
cells (Ha2/5 clone) have a high potency to form colonies and efficiently
proliferate on fibronectin-coated dishes. Furthermore, the meat buds
created from [CD29]{.caps}+ cells could differentiate into muscle and
adipose cells in a three-dimensional structure. The meat buds embedded
in the collagen gel proliferated in the matrix and formed large
aggregates. Approximately 10 trillion cells can theoretically be
obtained from 100 g of bovine tissue by culturing and amplifying them
using these methods. The [CD29]{.caps}+ cell characteristics of bovine
tissue provide insights into the production of meat alternatives
in vitro.
