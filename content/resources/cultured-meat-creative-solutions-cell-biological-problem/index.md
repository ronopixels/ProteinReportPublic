Cultured meat is an emerging technology that could address
environmental, health, and animal welfare concerns associated with meat
production. Development of cultured meat represents an exciting
challenge for cell biologists and engineers, but it requires effective,
open approaches for knowledge sharing to establish a fertile scientific
field alongside a competitiveÂ industry.
