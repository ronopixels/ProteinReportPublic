The United States has been a world leader in the nascent alternative
protein sector, which has quickly produced innovative, high-demand foods
with lower carbon emissions than animal protein sources, while avoiding
risk of zoonotic disease. These foods include meat and dairy products
made from plants, fungi or mycoprotein, insects, algae, fermentation,
and cultivated ("lab-grown" or "cell-based") meat.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its induced economic downturn is
threatening to wipe out the advances of the industry during an
inflection point, when many companies are raising funds, launching
production capacity, developing new products, or deploying them to
market. Although the animal livestock industry has been at the center of
the crisis' negative impacts and sales of some plant-based meat products
are thriving in grocery stores, the alternative protein industry is far
from secure:
