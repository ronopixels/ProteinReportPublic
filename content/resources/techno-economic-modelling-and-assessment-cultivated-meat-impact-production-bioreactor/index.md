Increases in global meat demands cannot be sustainably met with current
methods of livestock farming, which has a substantial impact on
greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water consumption. Cultivated
meat is a rapidly advancing technology that produces meat products by
proliferating and differentiating animal stem cells in large
bioreactors, avoiding conventional live-animal farming. While many
companies are working in this area, there is a lack of existing
infrastructure and experience at commercial scale, resulting in many
technical bottlenecks such as scale-up of cell fermentation and media
availability and costs. In this study, we evaluate theoretical
cultivated beef production facilities with the goal of envisioning an
industry with multiple facilities to produce in total 100,000,000 kg of
cultured beef per year or \~0.14% of the annual global beef production.
Using the computer-aided process design software, SuperPro Designer®,
facilities are modelled to create a comprehensive techno-economic
analysis ([TEA]{.caps}) to highlight improvements that can lower the
cost of such a production system and allow cultivated meat products to
be competitive. Three facility scenarios are presented with different
sized production reactors; 42,000 L stirred tank bioreactor
([STR]{.caps}) with a base case cost of goods sold ([COGS]{.caps}) of
\$30.4/kg, 210,000 L [STR]{.caps} with a [COGS]{.caps} of \$20.8/kg, and
260,000 L airlift reactor ([ALR]{.caps}) with a [COGS]{.caps} of
\$13.0/kg. This study outlines how advances in scaled up bioreactors and
decreased media costs are necessary for commercialization of cultured
meat products.
