Protein alternatives are crucial for a sustainable food production in
future. Cultured meat is presented as a good alternative for consumers
who want to be more sustainable but do not wish to change their diet. To
validate this sustainability claim, this report evaluates four
[LCA]{.caps} studies on cultured meat. When comparing overall
environmental impact of cultured meat with conventional meat products
and other meat substitutes, cultured meat was seen to perform
significantly better than beef, favourable to pork, similar to chicken,
and worse than plant-based alternatives considering current global
average production impacts. It is important to realize that currently no
commercial-scale cultured meat facility is operational. All [LCA]{.caps}
studies modelled a future facility, extrapolating scientific and
small-scale facilities. Differences in system boundaries lead to high
variability of environmental impact results for cultured meat among
reviewed studies. The [LCA]{.caps} system boundaries mostly include the
cultivation-related processes, while product formulation and
distribution are not taken into account. An important technical
bottleneck that is not addressed are the large volumes of the fermenters
and the extended cultivation times, which will need extraordinary
sterility measures. The [LCA]{.caps} overview shows that cultured meat
production is energy intensive and that energy consumption have the
highest contribution in the overall impact. Next, growth medium
production showed significant contribution to impact, especially the
amino acid production and recombinant protein production for growth
factors. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters showed that parameter
choices on cell density and medium use impacted the results most.
Technically, the cultured meat industry is still very much in
development. Obvious improvements that are needed are the reduction in
energy, development of scaffolds, and lower medium cost, specifically in
developing cheaper plant-based growth factors that are non [GMO]{.caps}.
Also product development is in its infancy. Cultured meat is part of a
movement towards more sustainable meat alternatives that also includes
plant-based alternatives, insects and microbial protein. These sources
should not be regarded as competition but as complementary products that
target different types of consumers. In combination with other meat
alternatives, cultured meat can lead to reduced production and
consumption of conventionalÂ meat.
