What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment
we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health
and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced
foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our
knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and
weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic
valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental
consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary
changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among
regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result
from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and
middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning
toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary
guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6--10% and food-related
greenhouse gas emissions by 29--70% compared with a reference scenario
in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health
would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental
benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects
the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of
improving diets to be 1--31 trillion [US]{.caps} dollars, which is
equivalent to 0.4--13% of global gross domestic product ([GDP]{.caps})
in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be
necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studiedÂ here.
