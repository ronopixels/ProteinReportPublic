Cultivating meat from stem cells rather than by raising animals is a
promising solution to concerns about the negative externalities of meat
production. For cultivated meat to fully mimic conventional meat\'s
organoleptic and nutritional properties, innovations in scaffolding
technology are required. Many scaffolding technologies are already
developed for use in biomedical tissue engineering. However, cultivated
meat production comes with a unique set of constraints related to the
scale and cost of production as well as the necessary attributes of the
final product, such as texture and food safety. This review discusses
the properties of vertebrate skeletal muscle that will need to be
replicated in a successful product and the current state of scaffolding
innovation within the cultivated meat industry, highlighting promising
scaffold materials and techniques that can be applied to cultivated meat
development. Recommendations are provided for future research into
scaffolds capable of supporting the growth of high-quality meat while
minimizing production costs. Although the development of appropriate
scaffolds for cultivated meat is challenging, it is also tractable and
provides novel opportunities to customize meat properties.
