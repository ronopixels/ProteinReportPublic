Cultivated meat harnesses tissue engineering ([TE]{.caps}) concepts to
create sustainable, edible muscle tissues, for addressing the rising
meat product demands and their global consequences. As 3D-printing is a
promising method for creating thick and complex structures, two
plant-protein-enriched scaffolding compositions were primarily assessed
in our work as 3D-printable platforms for bovine satellite cells
([BSC]{.caps}) maturation. Mixtures of Pea protein isolate
([PPI]{.caps}) and soy protein isolate ([SPI]{.caps}) with
[RGD]{.caps}-modified alginate (Alginate ([RGD]{.caps})) were evaluated
as prefabricated mold-based and 3D-printed scaffolds for [BSC]{.caps}
cultivation, and ultimately, as potential bioinks for cellular printing.
Mold-based protein enriched scaffolds exhibited elevated stability and
stiffness compared to ones made of Alginate ([RGD]{.caps}) alone, while
allowing unhindered [BSC]{.caps} spreading and maturation. Extrusion
based 3D-printing with the two compositions was then developed, while
using an edible, removable agar support bath. Successfully fabricated
constructs with well-defined geometries supported [BSC]{.caps}
attachment and differentiation. Finally, cellular bioprinting was
demonstrated with [PPI]{.caps}-enriched bioinks. Cell recovery
post-printing was observed in two cultivation configurations, reaching
∼80--90% viability over time. Moreover, cells could mature within
3D-printed cellular constructs. As animal-derived materials were avoided
in our scaffold fabrication process, and pea-protein is known for its
low allergic risk, these findings have great promise for further
cultivated meat research.
