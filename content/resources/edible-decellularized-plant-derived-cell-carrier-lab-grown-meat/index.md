description: "Rapidly expanding skeletal muscle satellite cells with cost-effective methods have been presented as a solution for meeting the growing global demand for meat. A common strategy for scaling cell proliferation employs microcarriers, small beads designed to support anchorage-dependent cells in suspension-style bioreactors. No carrier has yet been marketed for the cultivation of lab-grown meat. The objective of this study was to demonstrate a rapid, food safe, decellularization procedure to yield cell-free extracellular matrix scaffolds and evaluate them as cell carriers for lab grown meat."

Rapidly expanding skeletal muscle satellite cells with cost-effective
methods have been presented as a solution for meeting the growing global
demand for meat. A common strategy for scaling cell proliferation
employs microcarriers, small beads designed to support
anchorage-dependent cells in suspension-style bioreactors. No carrier
has yet been marketed for the cultivation of lab-grown meat. The
objective of this study was to demonstrate a rapid, food safe,
decellularization procedure to yield cell-free extracellular matrix
scaffolds and evaluate them as cell carriers for lab grown meat.
Broccoli florets were soaked in [SDS]{.caps}, Tween-20, and bleach for
48 h. The decellularization process was confirmed via histology, which
showed an absence of cell nuclei, and [DNA]{.caps} quantification
(0.0037 ± 0.00961 μg [DNA]{.caps}/mg tissue). Decellularized carriers
were sorted by cross sectional area (7.07 ± 1.74 mm2, 3.03 ± 1.15 mm2,
and 0.49 ± 0.3 mm2) measured for eccentricity (0.73 ± 0.16). Density
measurements of decellularized carriers (1.01 ± 0.01 g/cm) were
comparable to traditional microcarriers. Primary bovine satellite cells
were inoculated into and cultured within a reactor containing
decellularized carriers. Cell adhesion was observed and cell death was
limited to 2.55 ± 1.09%. These studies suggested that broccoli florets
may serve as adequate edible carrier scaffolds for satellite cells.
