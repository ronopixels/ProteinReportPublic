Worldwide, the demand for healthier protein is rapidly increasing due to
the population growth and health concerns associated with the
consumption of red meat. Animal welfare, disease prevention and
environmental challenges are the key driving factors for the development
of [meat
analogues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/meat-analog). [Mycoprotein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mycoprotein) is
a fungal-derived protein source that has been introduced as a more
sustainable and healthier meat alternative due to its fibrous structure
and unique functional profile.
