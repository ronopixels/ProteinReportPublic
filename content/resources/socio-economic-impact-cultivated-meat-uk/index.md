Oxford Economics researchers looked at the economic contribution to the
UK based on solely domestic consumer spending on cultivated meat in the
year 2030 and found:

-   The industry itself will be worth up to £1.7bn by 2030 in the UK --
    and will support a total GVA contribution to UK GDP of up to £2.1bn
    once the UK supply chain is factored in
-   The cultivated meat industry will have a 'GDP multiplier' of x3.7 in
    2030 -- for every £1m of GVA created by the industry, a further
    £2.7m is expected to be supported elsewhere in the UK economy that
    year
-   The British cultivated meat industry could support up to 16,500 jobs
    across the UK in 2030 -- up to 8,300 workers (50%) employed directly
    by the cultivated meat industry and the rest in the supply chain
-   The cultivated meat sector would account for roughly 12% of consumer
    demand for meat in 2030
-   The industry will have an 'employment multiplier' of x2 in 2030 --
    for every 100 jobs in the industry, a further 100 will likely be
    supported elsewhere in the UK economy
-   The UK risks losing out to countries such as US, Singapore and
    Israel, who are proactively supporting this new industry
