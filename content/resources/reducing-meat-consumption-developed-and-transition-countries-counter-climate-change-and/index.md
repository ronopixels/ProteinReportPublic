description: "A dietary shift towards reduced meat consumption is an efficient strategy for countering biodiversity loss and climate change in regions (developed and transition countries) where consumption is already at a very high level or is rapidly expanding (such as China). Biodiversity is being degraded and lost to a considerable extent, with 70 % of the world’s deforestation a result of stripping in order to grow animal feed. Furthermore, about 14.5 % of the world’s anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are calculated to be the result of (mainly industrial) livestock farming."

A dietary shift towards reduced meat consumption is an efficient
strategy for countering biodiversity loss and climate change in regions
(developed and transition countries) where consumption is already at a
very high level or is rapidly expanding (such as China). Biodiversity is
being degraded and lost to a considerable extent, with 70 % of the
world's deforestation a result of stripping in order to grow animal
feed. Furthermore, about 14.5 % of the world's anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions (GHG) are calculated to be the result of (mainly
industrial) livestock farming. The research reviewed here focuses on the
feasibility of reducing meat consumption in developed and transition
countries, as this would---among other positive effects---reduce the
global loss of biodiversity, the need for unsustainable agricultural
practices and GHG emissions. This article reviews the barriers,
opportunities and steps that need to be taken in order to encourage the
consumption of less meat, based on an interdisciplinary and multifactor
approach. The evidence is gathered from a systematic meta-analysis of
factors (including personal, sociocultural and external factors) that
influence individual meat-eating behaviour. The most relevant factors
that influence behaviour appear to be emotions and cognitive dissonance
(between knowledge, conflicting values and actual behaviour) and
sociocultural factors (e.g. social norms or social identity). For
different factors and groups of people, different strategies are
appropriate. For example, for men and older people deploying the health
argument or arguing for flexitarianism (reduced meat consumption) may
prove the most promising approaches, while providing emotional messages
or promoting new social norms is recommended in order to address
barriers such as cognitive dissonance.
