A significant body of literature has developed which examines why meat
consumption continues to be so important to Americans. Our paper
contributes to this literature by examining how fear of stigmatization
may be a barrier to avoiding meat consumption. This is an important
subject because there is evidence that suggests that individuals who
avoid meat, especially vegans, are stigmatized for disrupting social
conventions related to food. In this paper, we present data from a
series of focus groups in which vegan, vegetarian, and omnivorous
college students discussed perceptions of vegans and veganism. Our
analysis shows that non-vegans anticipate stigma associated with eating
like vegans. We identify two strategies by which non-vegans attempt to
avoid this stigma: social and behavioral distancing. These results
suggest that vegan stigma is a barrier that inhibits dietary shifts
toward a plant-based diet. Our results are important because they can be
used to improve the efficacy of public health initiatives focused on
encouraging plant-based diet adoption and meat consumptionÂ reduction.
