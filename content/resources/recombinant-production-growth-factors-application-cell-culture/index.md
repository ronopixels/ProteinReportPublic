Culturing eukaryotic cells has widespread applications in research and
industry, including the emerging field of cell-cultured meat production
colloquially referred to as "cellular agriculture". These applications
are often restricted by the high cost of growth medium necessary for
cell growth. Mitogenic protein growth factors ([GF]{.caps}s) are
essential components of growth medium and account for upwards of 90% of
the total costs. Here, we present a set of expression constructs and a
simplified protocol for recombinant production of functionally active
[GF]{.caps}s, including [FGF]{.caps}-2, [IGF]{.caps}-1,
[PDGF]{.caps}-[BB]{.caps} and [TGF]{.caps}-β1 in Escherichia coli. Using
this expression system, we produced soluble [GF]{.caps}s from species
including bovine, chicken, and fish. Bioactivity analysis revealed
orthologs with improved performance compared to commercially available
alternatives. We estimated that the production cost of [GF]{.caps}s
using our methodology will significantly reduce the cost of cell culture
medium, facilitating low-cost protocols tailored for cultured meat
production and tissue engineering.
