Public support mechanisms for agriculture in many cases hinder the
transformation towards healthier, more sustainable, equitable, and
efficient food systems, thus actively steering us away from meeting the
Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the Paris Agreement.

This report sets out the compelling case for repurposing harmful
agricultural producer support to reverse this situation, by optimizing
the use of scarce public resources, strengthening economic recovery from
the COVID-19 pandemic, and ultimately driving a food systems
transformation that can support global sustainable development
commitments.
