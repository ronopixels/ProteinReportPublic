description: "This report discuss the potentially wide-ranging benefits of alternative proteins but recognises the significant barriers that stand in the way. Many of these barriers are amenable to proactive, long-term policymaking. However, at present, UK policy in this space is fragmented and underdeveloped. A failure to act soon risks the UK falling behind international competitors, foregoing opportunities for British businesses, for attracting overseas businesses and investors, and hindering the transition to greener diets."

This report discuss the potentially wide-ranging benefits of alternative
proteins but recognises the significant barriers that stand in the way.
Many of these barriers are amenable to proactive, long-term
policymaking. However, at present, UK policy in this space is fragmented
and underdeveloped. A failure to act soon risks the UK falling behind
international competitors, foregoing opportunities for British
businesses, for attracting overseas businesses and investors, and
hindering the transition to greener diets.
