Can insects contribute to food and feed security?

Yes. Population growth, urbanization and the rising middle class have
increased the global demand for food, especially animal based
protein sources.

One of the many ways to address food and feed security is through insect
farming. Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly, and they
have high growth and feed conversion rates and a low environmental
footprint over their entire life cycle. They are nutritious, with high
protein, fat and mineral contents. They can be reared on waste streams
like food waste. Moreover, they can be eaten whole or ground into a
powder or paste, and incorporated into other foods. The use of insects
on a large scale as a feed ingredient is technically feasible, and
established companies in various parts of the world are already leading
the way in this regard. Insects as feedstock for aquaculture and poultry
feed are likely to become more prevalent within the next decade.
