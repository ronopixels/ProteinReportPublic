As a well-known source of nutrition and pleasure, meat plays an
important role in most people's diet. However, awareness of the "meat
paradox"--the association of liking to eat meat but not wanting to kill
animals--often implies the experience of [cognitive
dissonance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cognitive-dissonance "Learn more about Cognitive Dissonance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").
In two studies, focusing on meat production and meat consumption
respectively, we examined whether participants used reduction of
willingness to eat meat and reduction of mind attribution to food
animals as strategies to reduce cognitive dissonance from the meat
paradox in the Chinese and French cultural contexts. Focusing on meat
production (slaughtering of an animal to produce meat; Study 1,
n = 520), participants reported lower willingness to eat beef in a
condition that emphasized the slaughter of a cow compared to a condition
that presented a diagram of a cow as meat. In addition, French but not
Chinese participants attributed less mind to cows when the relation
between meat and its animal origin was made salient. Focusing on meat
consumption (the transformation of meat into food; Study 2, n = 518),
participants reported lower willingness to eat beef and attributed less
mind to cows in a condition that emphasized the animal origin of meat
compared to a condition that presented a recipe. These results suggest
that the use of different strategies to resolve cognitive dissonance
from the meat paradox depends on different contexts of the meat-animal
link as well as on cultural context.
