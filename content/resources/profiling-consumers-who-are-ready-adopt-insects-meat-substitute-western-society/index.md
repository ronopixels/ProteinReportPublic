description: "This study investigates the readiness of consumers in a Western society, where traditional meat consumption prevails, to adopt insects as a substitute for meat. Using cross-sectional data (n = 368) and binary logistic regression modeling, the study identifies gender, age, familiarity, food neophobia, convenience and environmental food choice motives, as well as meat-related attitudes and future meat consumption intentions as significant predictors."

This study investigates the readiness of consumers in a Western society,
where traditional meat consumption prevails, to adopt insects as a
substitute for meat. Using cross-sectional data (n = 368) and binary
logistic regression modeling, the study identifies gender, age,
familiarity, food neophobia, convenience and environmental food choice
motives, as well as meat-related attitudes and future meat consumption
intentions as significant predictors. The predicted likelihood of
adopting insects as a substitute for meat is 12.8% \[95% [CI]{.caps}:
6.1--19.4%\] for males and 6.3% \[95% [CI]{.caps}: 2.8--9.9%\] for
females, other predictor variables held constant at their mean value.
People who claim to be familiar with the idea of eating insects have a
2.6 times higher likelihood, and consumers who intend to reduce fresh
meat intake are up to 4.5 times more likely to adopt insects. Food
neophobia makes the largest contribution to consumers' readiness to
adopt insects: a one-unit increase in the food neophobia score is
associated with a 84% decrease in the predicted odds of being ready to
adopt insects. A stronger convenience orientation in food choice and a
higher interest in the environmental impact of food choice increase the
likelihood of adopting insects by 75% and 71% per unit increase in these
predictors' scores, respectively. By contrast, a one-unit stronger
belief that meat is nutritious and healthy, and a one-unit higher
importance attached to taste for meat lower the predicted odds by 64%
and 61%, respectively. This study reveals that the most likely early
adopters of insects as a novel and more sustainable protein source in
Western societies are younger males with a weak attachment to meat, who
are more open to trying novel foods and interested in the environmental
impact of their foodÂ choice.
