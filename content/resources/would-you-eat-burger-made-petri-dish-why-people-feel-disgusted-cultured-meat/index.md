Cultured meat---real animal flesh produced from in vitro cell cultures,
without the need to raise animals---is now poised to become publicly
available. Compared to conventional meat, cultured meat offers
environmental benefits in its production using less water and yielding
fewer greenhouse gas emissions. However, many people find cultured meat
too disgusting to eat.
