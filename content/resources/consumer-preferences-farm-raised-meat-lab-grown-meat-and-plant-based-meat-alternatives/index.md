description: "Despite rising interest in and sales of innovative non-animal-based protein sources, there remains a lack of information about consumer demand for these new foods and their ultimate market potential. This study reports the results of a nationwide survey of more than 1800 U.S. consumers who completed a choice experiment in which they selected among conventional beef and three alternative burger patties, (lab-grown, plant-based with pea protein, and plant-based with animal-like protein) at different&nbsp;prices."

Despite rising interest in and sales of innovative non-animal-based
protein sources, there remains a lack of information about consumer
demand for these new foods and their ultimate market potential. This
study reports the results of a nationwide survey of more than 1800
[U.S.]{.caps} consumers who completed a choice experiment in which they
selected among conventional beef and three alternative burger patties,

animal-like protein) at differentÂ prices.
