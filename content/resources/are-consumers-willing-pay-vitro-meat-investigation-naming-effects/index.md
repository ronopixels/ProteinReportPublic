Currently, there is an ongoing debate about whether '*in*-*vitro* meat'
(IVM) should be labelled and communicated differently from conventional
meat. Naming and labelling IVM can have significant implications and
consequences for consumers' acceptance of this new product as well as
for future labelling policies. We provide, for the first time,
information on how the use of different terms (i.e., 'cultured',
'lab-grown' and 'artificial') shapes US consumers' preferences and
marginal willingness to pay for IVM. Using a choice experiment involving
chicken meat products that vary across four attributes (i.e., production
method, carbon trust label, antibiotics use and price), our results show
that consumers prefer chicken meat produced through the conventional
production method and tend to generally reject IVM. However, the term
'cultured' is less disliked than the terms 'lab-grown' and 'artificial',
and 'artificial' is less disliked than 'lab-grown'. Results also
indicate that consumers' valuations are heterogeneous over differing
consumer attitudes. Our findings provide insights into the psychology of
consumers' level of acceptance and attitudes, which can be useful in
communicating the nature of the IVM to the public. They also have
important implications for future labelling policies.
