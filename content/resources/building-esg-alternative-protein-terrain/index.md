Alternative proteins are promising to be the growth engine food for the
food industry. Early integration of ESG risks and opportunities will
help companies, and their investors, avoid the pitfalls of the
conventional protein industry.

Although still a relatively nascent market, representing approximately
1% of the total protein market, alternative proteins are predicted to
reach \$17.9 billion by 2025. The long-term opportunity is even greater.
Sales are estimated to rise by up to \$1.1 trillion by 2040, eating up
60% of the total meat market.

FAIRR is working to build a standardised framework that will help
investors conduct adequate due diligence and drive transparency and
better disclosures on ESG investment risks in the alternative protein
sector.
