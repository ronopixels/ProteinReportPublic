Many individuals have empathetic feelings towards animals but frequently
consume meat. We investigate this "meat paradox" using insights from the
literature on motivated reasoning in moral dilemmata. We develop a model
where individuals form self-serving beliefs about the suffering of
animals caused by meat consumption in order to alleviate the guilt
associated with their dietary choices. The model makes several specific
predictions: in particular, it predicts a positive relationship between
individuals\\' taste for meat and their propensity to engage in
self-deception, a high price elasticity of demand for meat, and a causal
effect of prices and aggregate consumption on individual beliefs.
