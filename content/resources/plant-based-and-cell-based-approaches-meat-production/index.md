Advances in farming technology and intensification of animal agriculture
increase the cost-efficiency and production volume of meat. Thus, in
developed nations, meat is relatively inexpensive and accessible. While
beneficial for consumer satisfaction, intensive meat production inflicts
negative externalities on public health, the environment and animal
welfare. In response, groups within academia and industry are working to
improve the sensory characteristics of plant-based meat and pursuing
nascent approaches through cellular agriculture methodology (i.e.,
cell-based meat). Here we detail the benefits and challenges of
plant-based and cell-based meat alternatives with regard to production
efficiency, product characteristics and impactÂ categories.
