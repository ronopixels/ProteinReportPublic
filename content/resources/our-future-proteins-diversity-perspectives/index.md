description: "On 7 March 2023, the open-access book Our Future Proteins has been launched. In this book, 100+ experts present their views on the transition to sustainable protein production and consumption. Their visions cover a wide range of transition directions, from radically rethinking protein production systems to a pragmatic approach balancing global and local supply chains. By allowing a diversity of (sometimes divergent) perspectives, the book provides a snapshot of a dynamic transition in progress. Four of the editors are associated with Wageningen University & Research."

On 7 March 2023, the open-access book Our Future Proteins has been
launched. In this book, 100+ experts present their views on the
transition to sustainable protein production and consumption. Their
visions cover a wide range of transition directions, from radically
rethinking protein production systems to a pragmatic approach balancing
global and local supply chains. By allowing a diversity of (sometimes
divergent) perspectives, the book provides a snapshot of a dynamic
transition in progress. Four of the editors are associated with
