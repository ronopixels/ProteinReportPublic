description: "Cultured meat is an emergent technology with the potential for significant environmental and animal welfare benefits. Accurate mimicry of traditional meat requires fat tissue; a key contributor to both the flavour and texture of meat. Here, we show that fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) are present in bovine muscle, and are transcriptionally and immunophenotypically distinct from satellite cells.

Cultured meat is an emergent technology with the potential for
significant environmental and animal welfare benefits. Accurate mimicry
of traditional meat requires fat tissue; a key contributor to both the
flavour and texture of meat. Here, we show that fibro-adipogenic
progenitor cells ([FAP]{.caps}s) are present in bovine muscle, and are
transcriptionally and immunophenotypically distinct from satellite
cells. These two cell types can be purified from a single muscle sample
using a simple fluorescence-activated cell sorting ([FACS]{.caps})
strategy. [FAP]{.caps}s demonstrate high levels of adipogenic potential,
as measured by gene expression changes and lipid accumulation, and can
be proliferated for a large number of population doublings,
demonstrating their suitability for a scalable cultured meat production
process. Crucially, [FAP]{.caps}s reach a mature level of adipogenic
differentiation in three-dimensional, edible hydrogels. The resultant
tissue accurately mimics traditional beef fat in terms of lipid profile
and taste, and [FAP]{.caps}s thus represent a promising candidate cell
type for the production of culturedÂ fat.
