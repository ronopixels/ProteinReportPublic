description: "Fermentation—the use of fungi, bacteria, mycelium, microalgae, and other microbes as a bioproduction platform—has a long history in food production. We wouldn’t have things like beer, kimchi, or sourdough bread without it. Today, fermentation is emerging as both a key alternative protein platform in its own right and an enabler for plant-based and cultivated meat, eggs, and dairy. "

Fermentation---the use of fungi, bacteria, mycelium, microalgae, and
other microbes as a bioproduction platform---has a long history in food
production. We wouldn't have things like beer, kimchi, or sourdough
bread without it. Today, fermentation is emerging as both a key
alternative protein platform in its own right and an enabler for
plant-based and cultivated meat, eggs, and dairy. 

This report dives into the primary ways fermentation is used in
alternative proteins, the competitive landscape, ingredient
applications, investment trends, opportunities for innovation, a
regulatory primer, new graphs and figures, and more.
