Men in the United States have higher rates of life-threatening diseases
than do women, in part due to behavioral differences in health
practices. We argue that men's enactment of masculinity in their daily
lives contributes to health behavior differences. We focus on meat
consumption, a masculine-stereotyped dietary practice that
epidemiological studies have linked to negative health outcomes. In
study 1, nationally representative survey data indicate men report less
healthy lifestyle preferences than do women, including less willingness
to reduce meat consumption. In study 2, an internet-based experiment
shows that experiencing a masculinity threat leads men to express more
attachment to meat consumption. In study 3, lab experiment data with a
different experimental manipulation and study population again indicate
that threats to masculinity influence men's meat preferences. These
results support the claim that men's masculinity maintenance may be one
factor contributing to gender differences in meat consumption and health
disparities related to overconsumption of meat.
