Cultured meat is one of a number of alternative proteins which can help
to reduce the demand for meat from animals in the future. As cultured
meat nears commercialization, research on consumers' perceptions of the
technology has proliferated. We build on our 2018 systematic review to
identify 26 empirical studies on consumer acceptance of cultured meat
published in peer-reviewed journals since then. We find support for many
of the findings of our previous review, as well as novel insights into
the market for cultured meat. We find evidence of a substantial market
for cultured meat in many countries, as well as markets and demographics
which are particularly open to the concept. Consumers mostly identified
animal- and environment-related benefits, but there is plenty of
potential to highlight personal benefits such as health and food safety.
The safety of cultured meat and its nutritional qualities are
intuitively seen as risks by some consumers, although some recognize
potential benefits in these areas. Evidence suggests that acceptance can
be increased with positive information, as well as frames which invoke
more positive associations. We conclude by arguing that cultured meat
will form one part of a varied landscape of future protein sources, each
appealing to different groups of consumers to achieve an overall
reduction in conventional meat consumption. We acknowledge a range of
pro-cultured meat messaging strategies, and suggest that framing
cultured meat as a solution to existing food safety problems may be an
effective approach to increase acceptance. In the long-term, objections
based in neophobia and norm violation will decrease, and widespread
acceptance will depend in large part on the price and taste.
