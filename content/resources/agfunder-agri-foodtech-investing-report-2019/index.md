Following on from a record-breaking 2018, that’s a 4.8% decline year-over-year in dollar terms and 15% by number of deals. But there were some clear bright spots with a 1.3% increase in funding to startups operating upstream — on the farm and in the supply chain — as they raised $7.6bn, posting the highest levels of record during any H2 on record."

Foodtech and agtech startups raised \$19.8bn in venture funding across
1858 deals. Following on from a record-breaking 2018, that's a 4.8%
decline year-over-year in dollar terms and 15% by number of deals. But
there were some clear bright spots with a 1.3% increase in funding to
startups operating upstream --- on the farm and in the supply chain ---
as they raised \$7.6bn, posting the highest levels of record during any
H2 on record.
