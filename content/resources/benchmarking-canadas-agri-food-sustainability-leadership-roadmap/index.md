consider the need for developing a national sustainability benchmark for
Canada's agri-food sector. By concluding phase one of a broader plan to
advance this matter, this report focuses n examining why better
benchmarking is needed, how it can be expressed and what value it
confers to society, sector competitiveness and policy-making. This
current work will be used immediately to engage even more Canadian
agri-food stakeholders, setting the stage for phase two to proceed, if
embraced by agri-food leaders.
