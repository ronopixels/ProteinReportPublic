Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore reasons behind meat
consumption. It aims to find out what motivates meat consumers and
explore the opportunities of social marketing to counteract negative
environmental and health trends. Design/methodology/approach: An
exploratory Australian survey of Sydney consumer red meat choices is
used covering dietary preferences, meat eating patterns, reasons and
levels of concern for economic and environmental issues. Analysis of
dietary guidelines and marketing campaigns in relation to the survey
findings is conducted. Findings: The survey highlights: lack of
awareness about the link between meat consumption and environmental
well-being; widespread inaccuracy of health messages related to meat
consumption; influence of the meat industry in promoting excessive meat
consumption; pervasiveness of the link between red meat consumption and
national identity, social status, prestige and masculinity; and urgent
need for government-supported social marketing interventions and the
demarketing of meat. Originality/value: This is the first study to
propose social marketing based on the health and environmental
co-benefits of reduced red meatÂ consumption.
