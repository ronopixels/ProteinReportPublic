description: "This work advances towards an increased understanding of moral disengagement and individual differences in the maintenance of widespread and cherished harmful behaviors. Drawing on meat consumption and substitution as an opportunity to study the process of moral self-regulation in situ, it presents a measure of selective deactivation of moral self-regulatory processes when considering the impact of meat consumption (i.e. the Moral Disengagement in Meat Questionnaire — MDMQ). The MDMQ developed from four sequential studies following a mixed-methods approach."

This work advances towards an increased understanding of moral
disengagement and individual differences in the maintenance of
widespread and cherished harmful behaviors. Drawing on meat consumption
and substitution as an opportunity to study the process of moral
self-regulation in situ, it presents a measure of selective deactivation
of moral self-regulatory processes when considering the impact of meat
consumption (i.e. the Moral Disengagement in Meat Questionnaire ---
MDMQ). The MDMQ developed from four sequential studies following a
mixed-methods approach. Two preliminary studies (40 and 410
participants, respectively) provided input to develop the construct and
initial pool of items. Two additional studies (1016 and 318
participants, respectively) allowed the assessment of item selection,
factor structure, reliability, [convergent and concurrent
validities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/convergent-validity "Learn more about Convergent Validity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"),
predictive ability, and [measurement
invariance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/measurement-invariance "Learn more about Measurement Invariance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").
The MDMQ was associated with a variety of individual differences
concerning moral self-regulation (i.e. propensity to morally disengage;
moral
identity; [empathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/empathy "Learn more about Empathy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages");
moral emotions) and endorsement of dominance ideologies (i.e. social
dominance orientation; speciesism; human supremacy beliefs). In a
sequential mediation model, frequency of meat consumption affected
willingness towards meat substitution indirectly via meat attachment and
moral disengagement. We offer an interpretation of moral disengagement
as a motivated reasoning process which is triggered by loss aversion and
dissonance avoidance.
