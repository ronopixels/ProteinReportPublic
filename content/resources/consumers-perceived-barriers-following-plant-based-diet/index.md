Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to analyze the barriers
perceived by consumers to lowering their meat consumption levels and
adopting a plant-based diet, which means a diet that includes mainly
non-meat foods, yet it can contain both vegetarian and meat meals.
Design/methodology/approach -- The prevalence of different barriers for
following a plant-based diet is addressed, as well as consumer profiles
considering socio-demographics, values and meat consumption frequencies.
The data were collected in 2010 by a survey questionnaire, sent to 4,000
randomly selected Finns (response rate=47.3, n=1,890). Findings --
Different types of barriers are perceived to hinder the adoption of a
plant-based diet, including meat enjoyment, eating routines, health
conceptions and difficulties in preparing vegetarian foods. These
barriers are strongly correlated, indicating that consumers may not make
qualitative difference between different barriers. Furthermore, there
are distinct socio-demographic, value and especially meat consumption
frequency elements that strengthen the barrier perception, these being
male gender, young age, rural residence, household type of families with
children, low education, absence of a vegetarian family member or
friend, valuation of traditions and wealth and high meat consumption
frequency. Social implications -- High meat consumption is related to
many environmental and public health problems. The results call for
multifaceted policy implications that should concentrate on different
barriers and certain socio-demographic, value and meat eating groups.
Importantly, focus should be not only on the group with the strongest
barrier perception but also on those particularly willing to make
changes in their meat consumption patterns. One practical implication
could be to increase the availability of vegetarian foods in public
cafeterias or school canteens, as a decrease in meat consumption
frequency is strongly correlated with the alleviation of the barrier
perception. Originality/value -- Information about differences in
socio-demographics, values and meat consumption frequencies between
consumers provide opportunities for focussing policy actions to aid the
adoption of a plant-based diet.
