Increasing global levels of meat consumption are a threat to the
environment and to human health. To identify measures that may change
consumption patterns towards more plant-based foods, it is necessary to
improve our understanding of the causes behind the demand for meat. In
this paper we use data from 137 different countries to identify and
assess factors that influence meat consumption at the national level
using a cross-country [multivariate
regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/multivariate-regression) analysis.
We specify either total meat or ruminant meat as the dependent variable
and we consider a broad range of potential drivers of meat consumption.
The combination of explanatory variables we use is new for this type of
analysis. In addition, we estimate the relative importance of the
different drivers. We find that income per capita followed by rate of
urbanisation are the two most important drivers of total meat
consumption per capita. Income per capita and natural endowment factors
are major drivers of ruminant meat consumption per capita. Other drivers
are Western culture, Muslim religion, female labour participation,
economic and social globalisation and meat prices. The main identified
drivers of meat demand are difficult to influence through direct policy
intervention. Thus, acting indirectly on consumers' preferences and
consumption habits (for instance through information, education policy
and increased availability of ready-made plant based products) could be
of key importance for mitigating the rise of meat consumption per capita
all over the world.
