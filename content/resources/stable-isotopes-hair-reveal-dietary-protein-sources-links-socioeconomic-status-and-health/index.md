Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in hair sampled from 65 communities
across the central and intermountain regions of the United States and
more intensively throughout 29 [ZIP]{.caps} codes in the Salt Lake
Valley, Utah, revealed a dietary divergence related to socioeconomic
status as measured by cost of living, household income, and adjusted
gross income. Corn-fed, animal-derived proteins were more common in the
diets of lower socioeconomic status populations than were plant-derived
proteins, with individual estimates of animal-derived protein diets as
high as 75%; United States towns and cities averaged 57%. Similar
patterns were seen across the socioeconomic status spectrum in the Salt
Lake Valley. It is likely that corn-fed animal proteins were associated
with concentrated animal-feeding operations, a common practice for
industrial animal production in the United States today. Given recent
studies highlighting the negative impacts of animal-derived proteins in
our diets, hair carbon isotope ratios could provide an approach for
scaling assessments of animal-sourced foods and health risks in
communities across the UnitedÂ States.
