description: "This working paper provides an update to FAIRR’s ‘An Industry Infected’ report, looking at 60 of the largest protein producers’ performance against a set of indicators related to emerging disease risks. The results show that too little has been done since our original report in 2020, with 63% of the 60 companies still ranked as “High Risk” (or worst performers) in the ranking. However, there is some improvement from our report last year when 73% of companies were ranked as “High Risk”. The paper also aims to shed light on policy developments that aim to prevent future zoonotic diseases."

This working paper provides an update to FAIRR's 'An Industry Infected'
report, looking at 60 of the largest protein producers' performance
against a set of indicators related to emerging disease risks. The
results show that too little has been done since our original report in
2020, with 63% of the 60 companies still ranked as "High Risk" (or worst
performers) in the ranking. However, there is some improvement from our
report last year when 73% of companies were ranked as "High Risk". The
paper also aims to shed light on policy developments that aim to prevent
future zoonotic diseases.
