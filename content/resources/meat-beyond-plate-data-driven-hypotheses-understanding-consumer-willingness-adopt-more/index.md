A shift towards reduced meat consumption and a more plant-based diet is
endorsed to promote sustainability, improve public health, and minimize
animal suffering. However, large segments of consumers do not seem
willing to make such transition. While it may take a profound societal
change to achieve significant progresses on this regard, there have been
limited attempts to understand the psychosocial processes that may
hinder or facilitate this shift. This study provides an in-depth
exploration of how consumer representations of meat, the impact of meat,
and rationales for changing or not habits relate with willingness to
adopt a more plant-based diet. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was
employed to examine participant responses (N = 410) to a set of
open-ended questions, free word association tasks and closed questions.
Three clusters with two hallmarks each were identified: (1) a pattern of
disgust towards meat coupled with moral internalization; (2) a pattern
of low affective connection towards meat and willingness to change
habits; and (3) a pattern of attachment to meat and unwillingness to
change habits. The findings raise two main propositions. The first is
that an affective connection towards meat relates to the perception of
the impacts of meat and to willingness to change consumption habits. The
second proposition is that a set of rationales resembling moral
disengagement mechanisms (e.g., pro-meat justifications;
self-exonerations) arise when some consumers contemplate the
consequences of meat production and consumption, and the possibility of
changingÂ habits.
