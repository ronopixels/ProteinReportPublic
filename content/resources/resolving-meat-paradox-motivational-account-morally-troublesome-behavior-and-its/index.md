description: "A majority of people the world over eat meat, yet many of these same people experience discomfort when the meat on their plate is linked to the death of animals. We draw on this common form of moral conflict—the meat-paradox—to develop insights into the ways in which morally troublesome behaviors vanish into the commonplace and every day. Drawing on a motivational analysis, we show how societies may be shaped by attempts to resolve dissonance, in turn protecting their citizens from discomfort associated with their own moral conflicts."

A majority of people the world over eat meat, yet many of these same
people experience discomfort when the meat on their plate is linked to
the death of animals. We draw on this common form of moral
conflict---the meat-paradox---to develop insights into the ways in which
morally troublesome behaviors vanish into the commonplace and every day.
Drawing on a motivational analysis, we show how societies may be shaped
by attempts to resolve dissonance, in turn protecting their citizens
from discomfort associated with their own moral conflicts. To achieve
this, we build links between dissonance reduction, habit formation,
social influence, and the emergence of social norms and detail how our
analysis has implications for understanding immoral behavior and
motivations underpinning dehumanization and objectification. Finally, we
draw from our motivational analysis to advance new insights into the
origins of prejudice and pathways through which prejudice can be
maintained and resolved.
