description: "With the current interest in cultured meat, mammalian cell-based meat has mostly been unstructured. There is thus still a high demand for artificial steak-like meat. We demonstrate in vitro construction of engineered steak-like tissue assembled of three types of bovine cell fibers (muscle, fat, and vessel). Because actual meat is an aligned assembly of the fibers connected to the tendon for the actions of contraction and relaxation, tendon-gel integrated bioprinting was developed to construct tendon-like gels."

With the current interest in cultured meat, mammalian cell-based meat
has mostly been unstructured. There is thus still a high demand for
artificial steak-like meat. We demonstrate in vitro construction of
engineered steak-like tissue assembled of three types of bovine cell
fibers (muscle, fat, and vessel). Because actual meat is an aligned
assembly of the fibers connected to the tendon for the actions of
contraction and relaxation, tendon-gel integrated bioprinting was
developed to construct tendon-like gels. In this study, a total of 72
fibers comprising 42 muscles, 28 adipose tissues, and 2 blood
capillaries were constructed by tendon-gel integrated bioprinting and
manually assembled to fabricate steak-like meat with a diameter of 5 mm
and a length of 10 mm inspired by a meat cut. The developed tendon-gel
integrated bioprinting here could be a promising technology for the
fabrication of the desired types of steak-like cultured meats.
