The meat production industry is one of the leading contributors of
greenhouse gas emissions. Cultured meat presents itself as a potential
eco- and animal-friendly meat substitute which has the potential to
eradicate animal cruelty and reduce both the environmental footprint and
the risk of zoonotic illnesses, while delivering a nutrient-dense
product. The purpose of this study was to investigate how consumers
perceive cultured meat and if the frequency of meat consumption is
related to their intention of trying or purchasing cultured meat. Data
were collected online in 2020 from Croatia, Greece, and Spain. Among the
2007 respondents, three segments were identified according to meat
consumption and variety, plus an a priori identified group of "non-meat
eaters". Sixty percent perceived cultured meat as kind to animals, 57%
as unnatural, 45% as healthy and environmentally-friendly, 21% as
disgusting, and only 16% as tasty. Although 47% of the respondents had
not heard of cultured meat before, 47% would taste it and 41% would
purchase it for the same price as conventional meat. This indicates that
consumers from Croatia, Greece and Spain might be likely to purchase
cultured meat if sold at an affordableÂ price.
