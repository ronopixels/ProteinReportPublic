description: "Cell-cultured meat offers the potential for a more sustainable, ethical, resilient, and healthy food system. However, research and development has been hindered by the lack of serum-free media that enable the robust expansion of relevant cells (e.g., muscle satellite cells) over multiple passages. Recently, a low-cost serum-free media (B8) was described for pluripotent stem cells. Here, B8 is adapted for bovine satellite cells through the addition of a single component, recombinant albumin, which renders it suitable for long-term satellite cell expansion without sacrificing myogenicity."

Cell-cultured meat offers the potential for a more sustainable, ethical,
resilient, and healthy food system. However, research and development
has been hindered by the lack of serum-free media that enable the robust
expansion of relevant cells (e.g., muscle satellite cells) over multiple
passages. Recently, a low-cost serum-free media (B8) was described for
pluripotent stem cells. Here, B8 is adapted for bovine satellite cells
through the addition of a single component, recombinant albumin, which
renders it suitable for long-term satellite cell expansion without
sacrificing myogenicity. This new media (Beefy-9) maintains cell growth
over the entire period tested (seven passages), with an average doubling
time of 39â€‰h. Along with demonstrated efficacy for bovine cells, Beefy-9
offers a promising starting-point for developing serum-free media for
other meat-relevant species. Ultimately, this work offers a foundation
for escaping cultured meat research's reliance on serum, thereby
accelerating the field.
