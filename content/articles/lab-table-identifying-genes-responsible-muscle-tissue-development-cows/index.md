What distinguishes a muscle cell from a fat cell or a skin cell? The
answer is "gene expression." More precisely, the particular combination
of genes that are "turned on or off" in a cell which dictates cellular
morphology and function. Although genome sequencing and analysis
have been employed vastly in the study of disease and pharmaceuticals,
there has been little application in the emerging field of
cellular agriculture.

The process of cultivating meat requires exposing stem cells to the
environmental cues necessary for them to proliferate and then
differentiate into the specialized cells which eventually mature into
the tissue characteristic of meat.

As most consumers are familiar with, the majority of meat products are
composed of muscle tissue with small quantities of fat. A challenge then
becomes finding a way to ensure these initial stem cells reliably
differentiate into some combination of muscle cells and fat cells.

In thinking about how this can be done, the natural place to start is by
considering how the process is already accomplished in vivo, as most in
vitro bioprocesses are based on replicating the existing bodily
functions responsible for the development of specialized tissue.

In living organisms, cell function operates according to the central
dogma of molecular biology, which specifies that DNA transcribes mRNA
which translates into proteins. These proteins are what dictate the role
of that cell and is essentially what characterizes a cell as a blood
cell as opposed to a neuron, for instance. The transcriptome of a cell
is the set of genes which are translated from mRNA into proteins, and so
while almost every cell in the mammalian body has the same genome, they
may have different "isoforms" of a transcriptome. This ultimately leads
to different sets of proteins being created, thus leading to distinct
cell specializations.

As such, a change in a cell's function is caused by a change in its
transcriptome as a response to external or internal stimuli such as
development or exposure to a drug. During this process, specific genes
are either up-regulated (expressed more) or down-regulated (repressed
more). A gene is considered significantly differentially expressed if it
is upregulated or downregulated beyond a predetermined threshold.
Differential gene expression analysis is the process of identifying such
genes by comparing two or more transcriptomes.

This year, I entered my project *Lab to Table: A differential gene
expression analysis of RNA-sequenced bovine stem cells & myocytes* into
the Ottawa Regional Science Fair. The purpose of this study was to
design a bioinformatics pipeline to conduct a differential gene
expression analysis on the transcriptomes of a bovine embryonic stem
cell (ESC) and an adult myocyte (precursor to muscle tissue) in order to
identify the genes responsible for bovine myocyte differentiation. The
idea is that if we can find what these genes are, we can selectively
activate them within stem cells so that in a cellular agriculture
bioprocess they reliably differentiate into myocytes characteristic of
meat that consumers would be willing to buy.

The two samples used here were obtained using RNA-sequencing (similar to
genome sequencing but for mRNA) and are available on the NCBI Genbank
database. They both came from bovine longissimus muscle --- one from an
ESC and the other from a myocyte. The differential gene expression
analysis was run using a pipeline (series of algorithms) on the Galaxy
Project public web server pictured below.

Running this pipeline and filtering the data resulted in 23 genes that
were significantly differentially expressed: 10 of which were
upregulated and 13 of which were downregulated over the process of
development from a bovine ESC into a myocyte. These genes were then
queried against the DAVID database which contains the functional
annotation of genes across many organisms. Nine genes in particular
stood out as being related to the development of muscle tissue.

In terms of next steps for this particular project, it would be useful
to actually selectively upregulate or downregulate a subset of these
genes within an ESC and monitor how the cell's differentiation into a
myocyte is impacted in practice. It would also be interesting to run a
similar study regarding differentiation into adipocytes to further
explore the possibility of creating cultivated products which have a
balance of both tissue types. Comparing the gene analogs of different
species of cows or the transcriptomes of cows raised on different diets
would help to understand how the resulting modifications in gene
expression influence organoleptic properties such as taste and texture
of the resulting meat.
