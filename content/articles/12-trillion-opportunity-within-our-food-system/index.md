It's a sick and tragic sight. Across the US, dairy producers [are
currently
dumping](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/03/coronavirus-forces-dairy-farmers-dump-milk-wisconsin-covid-19/2939959001/) tens
of thousands of gallons of milk into fields and lagoons, as demand
continues to plummet. It makes me think about the country's more than [9
million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194934/number-of-milk-cows-in-the-us-since-1999/) dairy
cows, forced to live out their highly unnatural lives, in dark, cramped
milk-making prisons, often [sick and in
pain](https://www.ciwf.com/farmed-animals/cows/dairy-cows/welfare-issues/) ---
just to keep pumping out a useless commodity. The same could be said of
the US meat industry, which slaughters [9.59
billion](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-meat-domestic-data/livestock-meat-domestic-data/#Livestock%20and%20poultry%20slaughter) land
animals a year. To make matters worse, President Trump [ordered
slaughterhouses](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52466502) to
stay open despite the clear danger to public health. This is something
we can fix.

Here's the sadder truth: For America's modern dairy industry, milk
dumping is a common practice --- pandemic or not. Several years back,
American dairy farmers **discarded 43 million gallons of milk in the
first 8 months** of the calendar year alone. This is all because the
industry absurdly keeps making milk no one wants to buy...and the
government pays them to do it. Or, they buy it and turn it into cheese.
At the start of 2019, the U.S. reached a record high milk surplus,
resulting in [1.4 billion
pounds](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683339929/nobody-is-moving-our-cheese-american-surplus-reaches-record-high) of
unwanted cheese. By the way, there is also a [2.5 billion
pound](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/7/24/17606958/meat-cheese-surplus-visualized) meat
surplus --- and in 2018, producers were running out of space to store it
all. Both industries have been overproducing for years.

Cow-based dairy consumption in the US has [been steadily
declining](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/5-charts-that-show-how-milk-sales-have-changed.html) for
decades, but even just a few years ago the government still granted the
sector an unbelievable \$22 billion in aid, which helped make up [73
percent](https://www.realagriculture.com/2018/02/u-s-dairy-subsidies-equal-73-percent-of-producer-returns-says-new-report/) of
dairy farmers' marketplace "earnings." This isn't exclusive to the US
--- the EU subsidizes meat and dairy farms with an estimated £24
billion, [nearly a
fifth](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/nearly-a-fifth-of-eu-budget-goes-on-livestock-farming-greenpeace) of
the EU budget, in taxpayer money.

This makes no sense and people should be outraged at this wasteful,
outdated government practice of subsidizing dying food industries. This
needs to change now. Here's how:

**Stop giving billions of dollars to industries that are hazardous to
human health.** Here's a major contradiction: The American government
says we should fill [50% of our
plates](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate) with fruits and vegetables
to stay healthy. But its own agriculture policies then offer less than
1% of farm subsidies to support the research, production, and marketing
of fruits and vegetables. Instead, it doles out billions of dollars a
year toward meat and dairy production,
which [study](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/04/animal-protein-diets-smoking-meat-eggs-dairy) after [study](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/10/25/dairy-fat-cardiovascular-disease-risk/) link
to increased risk for cancer, diabetes, and other common serious health
ailments. A [recent
study](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002311) showed
that just a 10% national subsidy on fruits and vegetables could help
save 150,000 lives a year. This is simple math. What is the government
waiting for?

**Stop increasing environmental pollution with taxpayer
dollars.** Estimates [suggest](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2018.1528965?journalCode=tcpo20) that
at our current rate, cattle and other livestock will be responsible for
half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. [Decreasing meat
and
dairy](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) consumption
is the single biggest way for humans to reduce their environmental
impact on the planet. A recent [survey
showed](https://www.earthday.org/foodprintsreport/) that the majority of
Americans who buy fruit, vegetables, and meat and dairy alternatives do
it for environmental concerns. To take hard-earned taxpayer money and
use it to bolster food industries like dairy and meat goes against what
these taxpayers want.

**Divert precious funds to producing premium, plant-based crops.** Three
ounces of ham has 18 grams of protein. The same amount of roasted
pumpkin seeds has 27. The former causes harm to human health, animals,
and the environment, the latter does not. There are many high-potential
plant foods that offer higher concentrations of nutrients than meat and
dairy and are far healthier overall, and more sustainable. The
government must start diverting dairy and meat subsidies toward research
and production of healthier, more sustainable plant proteins including
nuts, lentils, seeds, flax, hemp, coconut, oats, rice, and peas.

**Support food industries with actual growth potential.** Globally,
plant-based protein and meat alternatives are projected to increase from
a \$4.6 billion industry in 2018 up to \$85 billion in 2030, [according
to investment firm
UBS](https://www.fooddive.com/news/plant-based-meat-market-forecast-to-reach-85b-by-2030-report-says/559170/),
at a rate of 20-to-30% per year. It's estimated that plant-based milk
will be a [\$38 billion
business](https://www.fooddive.com/news/plant-based-meat-market-forecast-to-reach-85b-by-2030-report-says/559170/) by
2025. In the United States, [41% of all
households](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch) already buy plant-based
milk, which equals almost 53 million households. As someone who actively
invests in plant-based companies, the opportunities are in promising new
growth industries --- not the obviously declining ones, like dairy.

Farm subsidies in the US took off during the Great Depression to help
affected farmers and stabilize markets. Nearly 100 years later, they are
no longer serving the purpose they were created for. Instead, they
support poor health and environmental destruction...100 years from now
there won't be anything left to subsidize!

These outdated subsidies happen around the world. The public is
providing more than *one million dollars per minute* in farm subsidies,
a lot of which is driving the climate crisis, according to a [new
report](https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/global-report/). Even
scarier, our current food system causes [\$12 trillion a
year](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03117-y) in hidden
costs to the environment, human health, and inclusive development.

It's time to wake up, start crying over spilled milk --- and do
something drastic about it. The Trump administration's handling of
slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants in the midst of the coronavirus
has only highlighted the corruption and fragility of these industries.
The solution is right in front of our faces: it's time to transition
away from antiquated industries toward a new, sustainable, plant-based
food system.
