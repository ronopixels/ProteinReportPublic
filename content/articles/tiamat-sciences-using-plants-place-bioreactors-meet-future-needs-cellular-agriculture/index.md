In 2040, [one
third](https://www.kearney.com/documents/20152/2795757/How+Will+Cultured+Meat+and+Meat+Alternatives+Disrupt+the+Agricultural+and+Food+Industry.pdf/06ec385b-63a1-71d2-c081-51c07ab88ad1)
of the meat on our plates could be grown outside of animals, drastically
reducing the leading sources of CO2 emissions and water pollution, while
answering the question of how to feed a global population of
nine billion.

Cellular agriculture companies such as [Memphis
Meats](/directory/memphis-meats), [BlueNalu](/directory/bluenalu), and
[Mosa Meat](/directory/mosa-meat) are racing to bring their products to
market, but they are still missing a key ingredient: affordable culture
media available in large quantities. Brussels-based startup [Tiamat
Sciences](/directory/tiamat-sciences) believes their technology platform
could become the best option to bridge that gap.

The Tiamat team is developing a plant-based molecular farming technology
to manufacture an affordable culture medium, growth factors, and other
proteins that will enable cell-based meats to become cost-competitive,
mainstream alternatives to their animal-based counterparts.

"Our unique technology allows exceptional flexibility with a production
system costing up to 60-times less than that of our current competitors,
and has greater potential to scale up to meet mass production
requirements," says Tiamat co-founder and CEO France-Emmanuelle Adil.

With cell culture media accounting for [up to
80%](https://www.gfi.org/files/sci-tech/clean-meat-production-volume-and-medium-cost.pdf)
of cell-based meat production costs, Tiamat believes their product is
the answer many have been looking for.

How does Tiamat achieve such dramatically lower production costs for
their media? By using plants instead of bioreactors to manufacture
their proteins.

**The limits of current recombinant protein technologies**

Recombinant proteins are produced using a gene sequence in combination
with an external system that will replicate and produce the desired
protein. Several technologies are currently used to create various
recombinant proteins from enzymes to antibodies to growth factors. In
many cases, they are the best alternatives for removing animal-based
products from biotechnology processes.

But currently, the two leading animal-free technologies rely on E. coli
or yeast systems, both of which come with high production costs. This is
mainly due to the expensive fermentation infrastructure (bioreactors),
and the high energy consumption associated with culturing, cleaning, and
sterilizing such installations. These technologies are also relatively
inflexible as a cell line needs to be designed prior to production, and
they come with potential risks of human pathogen contamination and the
resulting challenges of handling contaminated waste.

**Plants as natural bioreactors**

Tiamat's *PlanTech* technology utilizes plants to manufacture proteins
that will be used to produce essential ingredients for clean meats.
Using a tailored plant vector in combination with a pathogen, they
infect natural plants that then grow their proteins. This temporary and
local production is made possible by the plant's natural transient
expression ability. After a few days, the plants are harvested and the
proteins are extracted and purified to obtain the final products.

Besides culture media, Tiamat plans to use this process to produce a
range of growth factors, other ingredients for flavor and texture such
as leghemoglobin, and even leaf-based scaffolding for
cell-cultured meats.

**An ambitious roadmap**

In addition to their own production, Tiamat plans to offer "proteins as
a service" by licensing out their technology and management of
custom-tailored internal production facilities. They already have signed
agreements with six cellular agriculture companies that have expressed
interest in purchasing their products and have agreed to test them.

Tiamat's goal is to supply 50% of the market's cell culture media by
2040, with the first profitable production facility launching in 2021.
Between 2022 and 2024, the company plans to expand with a focus on the
European and Asian markets.

In terms of production quantities, an average cell-based meat company is
believed to use approximately [140,000
liters](https://www.gfi.org/files/sci-tech/clean-meat-production-volume-and-medium-cost.pdf)
of media to produce 10,000 kilograms of meat. Tiamat estimates their
first facility will contain 200,000 plants in an indoor vertical farm
able to produce 5,250 liters of media per month to supply medium-scale
cellular agriculture companies by 2024. By 2026, they hope to have 20
million plants producing 525,000 liters of media per month for medium
and large-scale cellular agriculture companies. They will also rely on
their low facility cost to open several new manufacturing centers close
to future clients.
