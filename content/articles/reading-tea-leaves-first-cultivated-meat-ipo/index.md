**How BlueNalu could become the world's most valuable seafood company**

Although cultivated meat isn't yet available to consumers outside
Singapore, more than 30 startups have raised venture funding and several
have introduced product tastings or proofs of concept. Over the next two
years, many will bring products to market leading to acquisitions and
IPOs as the industry matures. Looking toward this future, it's worth
considering how valuable cultivated meat companies could be.

So far, much of the focus has been on the cultivated beef industry,
highlighted by Memphis Meats' \$180 million in funding. But cultivating
seafood at commercial scales may be easier due to advantages of fish
cell tolerances to pH, temperature, and oxygen levels \[1\]. A trio of
VC-funded US companies are currently pursuing this vertical.

Among these three, BlueNalu leads the pack. With \$84 million raised to
date \[2\], the San Diego-based startup is the most well funded in the
cultivated seafood space. In January of 2021, they closed a \$60 million
convertible debt round with the intent to produce a pilot facility by
the end of the year \[3\]. The company's first product will be mahi mahi
after which they will add bluefin tuna and other species.

Wildtype is focused on salmon and has raised \$16 million for their
Seattle-based venture \[2\]. Finless Foods rounds out the cohort with
\$3.5 million in funding \[2\] to develop cultivated bluefin tuna. Like
many of the other startups in this space, they are based out of the San
Francisco Bay Area.

Pre-revenue companies are difficult to value, and cultivated meat
startups especially so being in a nascent industry using technology less
than ten years old. But the opportunity these companies are pursuing is
enormous. Fish and seafood make up a \$1 trillion global market and
\$102 billion domestic market \[4\].

The below table shows a sample of the largest incumbent seafood
companies in the world. The industry is less consolidated than beef and
poultry, which are dominated by a smaller number of companies. Product
lines cover wild-caught fish, farm-raised aquaculture, and combinations
of both. The average P/E ratio (15.5) of this cohort is comparable to
the broader Farming/Agriculture average (26.0) \[5\].

However, valuing cultivated seafood startups against the legacy fishing
industry is challenging. Although the end product from both sectors is
fish, the similarity ends there. The technology and cost drivers are
completely different. Fleets of fishing vessels and aquaculture lakes
will be replaced by bioreactors and growth media --- even a body of
water is unnecessary. Seafood supply chains spanning thousands of miles
will be replaced by cultivated fish facilities located near the
populations they serve. Landlocked countries will be able to
domestically produce all of the saltwater seafood they need to meet
demand to ensure food security.

Plant-based protein companies offer another potential comparison for
cultivated meat valuations. Beyond Meat's 2019 IPO saw the company
skyrocket to a \$3.8 billion valuation and demonstrated investor
excitement in plant-based protein. Impossible Foods raised \$200 million
in August of 2020 and is estimated to be worth \$4 billion \[6\].
However, it's likely cultivated meat companies will have more defensible
IP than plant-based protein companies \[7\] as well as a larger
potential market of consumers unwilling to move away from
animal-based meat.

Looking to other industries offers more valuation comparisons.
Cultivated seafood companies will create a high-volume, physical product
in a centralized facility. They will require a technical workforce and
defendable IP to be successful. In many ways, cultivated seafood is more
similar to the semiconductor industry than legacy seafood operations.
Although not a perfect analog (facility lifetimes, material costs,
etc.), consider the potential value of these startups with a
semiconductor enterprise value-to-sales ratio as they scale to meet the
tremendous demand for global seafood.

**Enterprise Value Ratio**

While many established corporations are valued based on earnings,
startup valuations are often determined based on revenue multiples using
the enterprise value-to-sales ratio. Enterprise value (EV) is calculated
as follows:

**EV = Market Capitalization + Market Value of Debt -- Cash
and Equivalents**

Enterprise value of mature companies divided by sales across the
aggregate can give an industry wide EV ratio. Significant to this
analysis, EV ratios vary *considerably* across industries.

**EV Ratio = EV / Sales**

Using the industry average EV ratio allows a valuation of a target
company by simply plugging in its sales.

**Target Company Sales \* Industry EV Ratio = Target Company EV**

New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran has generated a
thorough list of industry EV ratios \[5\]. Among those listed,
"Farming," "Food Processing," and "Food Wholesale" are the closest to
the legacy seafood industry. Food industries have relatively low EV
ratios due to cost structure and commodification. Conversely, the
semiconductor industry has a much higher EV ratio. At the far end of the
spectrum, internet software has one of the highest EV ratios due to the
negligible variable cost associated with producing software. The
business model of digital bits over physical atoms still reigns for the
most profitable companies in the world.

**BlueNalu**

Focusing on BlueNalu offers a snapshot of a potential cultivated meat
IPO. They are the most well capitalized among cell-based seafood
startups, and they have publicly announced plans to bring a product to
market by the end of 2021. BlueNalu CEO, Lou Cooperhouse, has described
this facility as "Phase 3." Ultimately, a scaled-up BlueNalu facility
will be "Phase 5" and capable of producing 18 million pounds of fish per
year \[3\].

{{< figure src="BlueNalu.jpg" alt="Potential BlueNalu valuation estimates" caption="Potential BlueNalu valuation estimates" >}}

Assuming a \$5.00/pound wholesale price, this Phase 5 facility will
generate annual revenues of \$90 million --- with a scalable model.
Applying the semiconductor EV ratio to these assumptions, BlueNalu would
be worth a \$3.2 billion valuation with just five facilities. Once 20
are operational, they would be worth \$12.8 billion and be the most
valuable seafood company in the world.

This is a conservative estimate as high-growth startups are often valued
on multiples much greater than their established competitors. Impossible
Foods, for instance, only has one facility but was still able to command
a \$4 billion valuation in private markets. This potential valuation
also does not account for licensing technology or other partnerships to
develop new revenue streams, nor does it include price premiums the
product could command for being free of the micro-plastics and mercury
in current fish products.

Reducing the cost of production to achieve price parity remains an
unsolved risk, but once this technical barrier is overcome, cultivated
seafood companies will likely be vastly more valuable than incumbent
seafood companies. Some will achieve "escape velocity" from being
acquired by incumbents and either be acquired by larger food companies
(Tyson, Nestle, etc.) or go for IPOs. This represents a huge potential
opportunity for investors looking for exposure in the alternative
protein space.
