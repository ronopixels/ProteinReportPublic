Over the past few years, the food industry has undergone a revolution,
as alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products flood an eager
marketplace. Advances in alternative protein technologies --- driven by
consumer demand for healthier, more sustainable food sources and
products --- have brought the once-niche category into the mainstream.
Though opportunity in this space is abundant, government regulators have
not yet caught up to the pace of new product innovation. The ability of
companies to market these cutting-edge products has been tempered for a
number of reasons by the current regulatory environment.

Consider the issue of sustainability claims. The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) is the regulatory body responsible for establishing
guidelines for environmental claims through its
[](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf)
\"[Green
Guides](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf).\"
They recently
[announced](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/02/2021-13724/regulatory-review-schedule)
that it will start reviewing and updating these guides in 2022. At the
conclusion of the last review process ten years ago, the FTC chose not
to define "sustainable" despite pressure from some sectors to do so. At
that time, they determined that there was no consensus among consumers
about the meaning of the term, thus preventing the commission from
developing and articulating appropriate guidance. In the intervening
years, however, the buzz around sustainability claims has only grown
louder. Given this new reality, it's possible the FTC may determine that
a single meaning exists, even if specific to particular product
categories --- allowing them to define it for regulatory purposes going
forward.

To the extent that the FTC decides to develop definitions and guidance
around sustainable claims in the upcoming review, alternative protein
companies will need to be ready for that discussion.

Start pulling together available data on this topic now and exploring
the necessity for additional study or analysis. Be ready to respond to
challenges that threaten to reduce access to such a claim. Alternative
protein marketers stand to be significantly impacted by the outcome of
this next review period, and should be prepared to take an active role
in its process.

Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the process of
updating its
"[healthy](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.65)"
claim regulation under the ongoing Nutrition Innovation Strategy, and is
also considering the adoption of a "healthy" symbol for product labels.
In requesting comments from stakeholders in 2016 and 2017 on this topic,
the FDA not only sought input on nutrient criteria but whether the claim
should be available for fortified products and what types of foods
should have access to such claims. The FDA signaled it may issue a
proposed rule to update "healthy" as soon as this September.  ** **

Given the significant implications that new regulations and guidance can
have for the alternative protein industry, it is important to ensure
that the end results are inclusive and comprehensive. Ambiguity on
accessibility to these claims for alternative protein products not only
puts companies at heightened risk of regulatory enforcement but also
increases exposure to class-action lawsuits if claims are deemed
inconsistent with requirements. Moreover, public blowback in the event
of such a negative outcome could impact the reputation of the entire
industry.

Going forward, it is imperative that the alternative protein industry is
a part of these regulatory discussions. Companies in this space need to
advocate for access to claims that provide a reasonable understanding of
how these new products support the health of consumers and the
environment. Opportunities for such advocacy will occur in the near
future at the regulatory level, and I encourage industry stakeholders to
be active participants in the process.
