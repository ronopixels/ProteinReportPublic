A recently founded startup from Australia has developed a novel edible
scaffold for cultivated meat production, addressing one of the key
challenges facing the cellular agriculture industry.

Perth-based [Cass Materials](/directory/cass-materials) has harnessed
the natural fermentation processes discovered in the production of nata
de coco --- a coconut jelly commonly used in desserts in the
Philippines --- to manufacture a nanocellulose fiber matrix within which
meat cells can adhere and grow. These nanocellulose fibers are also
produced in scoby, the symbiotic culture formed during the fermentation
of kombucha and several other naturally fermented foods and beverages.

Founder Gary Cass says the scaffold is tasteless, so as not to taint the
flavour of meat, and is a dietary fiber, which could improve the
nutritional value of cultivated meat. "You can have your protein and
dietary fiber in one bite!" says Cass.

Cellular agriculture is an evolving research field within the
alternative protein space that could generate meat and other materials
such as leather without the need for conventional animal agriculture.
This technology could have significant potential implications for
environmental sustainability, animal welfare, biodiversity, and human
health. However, recreating meat cuts with complex structures, such as
steak or chicken wings, requires the development of a 3D scaffold to
support multiple cell types such as muscle, bone, skin and fat. The
structural scaffold found in animal meat consists mainly of
collagen fibers.

"The BNC scaffolds' 3D fibrous matrix has similar physical dimensions to
collagen (human structural proteins) and has shown to successfully
scaffold animal cells in culture," says Cass.

"Being at the forefront of this emerging technology will give Cass
Materials the ability to supply a cost-effective and scalable scaffold
to the cultivated meat industry, while satisfying the high priority
objectives of lowering carbon emissions, utilising less water and less
arable land," Cass added.

While the goal for many cellular agriculture researchers is to optimize
large-scale cultivated meat production in order to reach price parity
with animal-farmed meat, Cass believes cultivated meat will enter the
market as a premium product --- and this could have a positive influence
on conventional animal farming. Drawing parallels to the egg industry,
Cass explains: "Once we realized what was happening to the hens in these
cages, it was no longer acceptable for our society. People are
increasingly willing to pay more for free-range eggs, and we've seen a
big movement in the industry overall toward more ethical practices."

Cass Materials is one of three Australian companies working towards
developing biocomponents involved in producing cultivated
meat --- alongside [Vow](/directory/vow-food) in Sydney and
[Heuros](/directory/heuros) in Brisbane --- and is collaborating with
other cellular agriculture companies around the world. In July, Cass
Materials was accepted into [Startmate](/directory/startmate)'s 12-week
accelerator program.
