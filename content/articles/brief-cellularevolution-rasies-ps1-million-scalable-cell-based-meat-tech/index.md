CellulaREvolution is a UK-based startup working to solve two problems
facing the cultivation of adherent cells for cultured meat: culture sera
and available surface area.

The company recently announced in a [press
release](/newswire/cellularevolution-raises-ps1m-further-accelerate-development-lab-grown-cells)
that they acquired £1 million in new funding from "a set of strategic
investors including CPT Capital, Stephan Schmidt, Orange Light Ventures,
and funds managed by Northstar Ventures, the North East Innovation Fund
supported by the European Regional Development Fund, and the newly
launched Northern Accelerator Seed Investment Fund (NASIF)."

CellulaREvolution raised pre-seed funds in 2019 through a mix of
non-dilutive grants and direct investments. Also the awardee of multiple
Innovate UK grants, the team is contemplating further fundraising during
2021: "As a startup we are always having discussions on future funding
rounds and capital requirements and we will most likely be doing
additional fundraising sometime in the coming year," CEO Leo Groenewegen
told *Protein Report*.

With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, fundraising has had its challenges.
"It made it basically impossible to meet investors face-to-face and so a
large proportion of the fundraising campaign has been conducted
remotely. This has presented new opportunities but also drawbacks,"
Groenewegen shared. Nevertheless, the company is satisfied with the
outcome --- in particular, their investment from CPT Capital, one of the
leading investors in the alternative protein sector.

CellulaREvolution's two main developments are a peptide coating that
increases cell proliferation in serum-free culture media and bioreactor
configurations able to continuously culture adherent cells. According to
Groenewegen, "the raised funds will be used to further develop both our
company and our products in general. We are now able to accelerate the
development of our technologies which allows us to make faster progress,
for example our bioreactor. It also allows us to recruit additional
personnel and pay for the new office and laboratory space we have just
moved into."
