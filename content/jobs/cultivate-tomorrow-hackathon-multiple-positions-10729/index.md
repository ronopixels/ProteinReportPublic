***Note: these are unpaid, volunteer opportunities for students.***

After the success of the inaugural Cultivate Tomorrow Hackathon,
Nucleate Cultivate is expanding their set of programs and opportunities
to reach a wider pool of students. In addition to the Hackathon,
Cultivate aims to host seminar series, workshops, career fairs, online
educational courses, community-building events, research competitions,
and many other events. Cultivate will engage and grow the sustainable
food tech talent pool in the coming years by providing opportunities for
education, research, and professional development in the cellular
agriculture and wider food tech field.

If you are interested in getting involved with the organization behind
these types of programs, please take a look at our open officer
positions that we are currently recruiting for. We are looking for
students passionate about the alternative protein space with excellent
leadership, communication, and innovation skills. Together we will help
build the infrastructure of the alt protein industry.
