**We are Planted.** After years of research, founded in July 2019 as a
spin-off from ETH Zurich, it is our very aim to make the world better.
With a revolutionary plan: Meat from plants.

Planted is more than a delicious product -- it's also an attitude. We
want to radically change the way people consume and perceive meat. And
to trigger a switch from eating animal- to plant-based proteins.

We are making a change. Not only because we can but because we have to.
Be part of our journey and join our Science Team as an Industrial
Biotechnologist.

As Industrial Biotechnologist, you will change the game with us. You
will work at the interface between research and industrial
implementation of fermented plant-based foods, making sustainable foods
even more sustainable, healthy and tasty. 

**Your mission:**

-   build and expand high performance fermentation platforms to upscale
    biotech innovations
-   implement and create new biotechnological processes internally and
    in collaboration with industrial partners
-   manage and organize multiple science and implementation projects in
    the interdisciplinary fields of biotechnology, material science, and
    food process engineering
-   align fermentation strategies to business and consumer needs and
    vice versa
-   actively contribute to and work on industrial projects in the field
    of biotechnology and plant-based raw materials
-   closely work together with our internal science and product
    development teams to upscale plant-based food products

 **You:**

-   are a self-driven person with a higher education specialized in
    (Bio)Chemical Engineering, Process Engineering, Food Biotechnology,
    Biotechnology or a similar background. A PhD in Biotechnology,
    Chemical Engineering or Microbiology is a plus.
-   have 5+ years industrial experience in the implementation of
    biotechnological processes, preferentially fermentation processes in
    the food related industry.
-   are experienced in working with industrial microbial fermentations
    and enzymes. 
-   have profound knowledge in growing microorganisms in small to large
    scale fermenters.
-   have a proven track-record in generating and dealing with
    intellectual property.
-   have strong negotiation skills and confidence in dealing with
    contracts.
-   are enthusiastic about working with microbes, plant-based meat and
    sustainable food.
-   are comfortable with working under pressure, unconventional
    scientific ideas and with handling unfamiliar situations and
    deadlines.
-   are a team-player and responsibility-taker with an entrepreneurial
    mindset and a high level of independence.
-   are creative and have a flexible mindset.
-   are a high performer with keen perception and willingness to go the
    extra mile.
-   have excellent communication skills.
-   are fluent in German and English.
-   are allowed to work in Switzerland (valid work permit).
