About Clara Foods™

Clara Foods™ is reimagining egg production. We join a new generation of
entrepreneurs, activists and scientists who recognize that the
decades-old factory farm model cannot sustain the dietary needs of 7
billion people and counting - and that technology may hold a solution.
As much as the growing market demands for egg production exert pressure
on hatcheries to improve their efficiencies and outputs, there is also
growing public distaste for the environmental, animal welfare, and
health compromises of industrial-scale egg production. Clara Foods™ aims
to subvert this moral and economic deadlock by taking the chicken out of
the equation. We're bringing an egg white to the table that is produced
completely animal-free, uses less land and water inputs, while matching
the taste, nutritional value, and unique culinary properties of
hen-borne egg whites.
