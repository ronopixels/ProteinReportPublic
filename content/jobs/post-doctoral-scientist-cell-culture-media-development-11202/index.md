Roslin Technologies is an ambitious, cutting‐edge biotech company
focused on food and agriculture. Our mission is to advance disruptive
biotechnologies to improve how we produce proteins. Alternative proteins
are key for a more sustainable food system. We envision a world where we
can produce animal proteins without harming our health, the planet, or
animals and ensure everyone has access to affordable, nutritious
proteins.

Our main focus is on developing animal cell technologies for the
emerging cultivated meat sector. We develop stem cell lines using
ground-breaking technologies, including induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC). We provide these cell lines to cultivated meat producers
globally who will use these cell lines to develop and produce cultivated
meat. Our approach is unique to this sector both in terms of technology
and business model. Our animal cell lines are playing a key role in
bringing the reality of cultivated meat closer.

Our brilliant team of experts are passionate, curious, inventive and at
the forefront of the ground-breaking work being accomplished in this
rapidly growing, cultivated meat sector.

**About the role**

The role is an exciting career opportunity for a post-Doctoral scientist
with extensive experience in cell culture media development.

Our Team has derived high quality animal stem cells, including induced
pluripotent stem cells. The next step is to show that these cells are
uniquely qualified to scale up to high densities in large bioreactors in
safe, cost-effective media. The role will involve you working across our
innovation and commercially facing teams developing and implementing
solutions fit-for-purpose media for our various cell lines. 

**Essential skills**

-   Undergraduate degree (BSc/MSc) and PhD in an appropriate discipline
    (Cell Biology, Bioprocessing, or Bioengineering)
-   Experience in working with adherent and/or suspension stem cell
    culture and/or experience in cell culture media design/development 
-   Excellent data analysis skills, ideally with experience in Design of
    Experiments approaches
-   Proven ability to develop and test protocols 
-   Proven ability to deliver a research project, including the design
    and execution of experiments
-   Excellent communication and presentation skills 
-   Excellent computer skills in the use of Office software
-   Industry experience of working to GMP and relevant ISO standards

**Desirable skills**

-   Practical experience of working in the area of cultivated meat,
    ideally focusing on scale up and cell density optimisation
-   Experience in project delivery/report writing and/or commercial R&D
    projects

**Roslin Technologies offers**

-   Competitive and attractive salary and company pension plan 
-   A passionate work environment focused on a fast-growing field, using
    ground-breaking stem cell technologies 
-   Strong emphasis on team performance and personal development 
-   Regular company events to foster our culture


**How to apply**


This role is for a permanent full-time contract. We will offer a
competitive and attractive compensation package.
