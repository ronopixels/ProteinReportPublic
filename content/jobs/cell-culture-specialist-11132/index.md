Ever heard of a concept called "**cultured meat**?" Kinda a big deal
these days...¬† We hope to succeed in bringing to people healthy and
**cruelty-free meat** as soon as possible. If you can help us do it,
check us out and apply.

**About us in a nutshell**ü•©\
We are **the first European cell-based** [food tech
startup](https://www.mewery.io/) developing cultivated **pork** on a
**microalgae**¬†base. Our unique microalgae technology aims to break down
barriers to scaling and accelerating the cultivated meat industry. We
are developing a porcine cell line for a proprietary hybrid media which
doesn't require FBS. It rather uses the microalgae growth factors to
significantly reduce the production costs of cultivated meat.

**Mewery is out there** üóûÔ∏è\
We have a [strong team](https://www.mewery.io/index.html#team) of
scientists with knowledge of mammalian as well as microalgae cells and
its cultivation. Now we could really use a Cell culture specialist /
Tissue engineer / Cell biologist, one of those. ü§ì

**What we need from you**üî¨\
You would be part of a team that is **developing** and **optimising
technological processes** in the cultured meat biotech industry. The
main focus is to establish highly effective and easy-to-reproduce
procedures **from isolation to large scale-ups of mammalian cells.**
Cell culture specialist will work in close interaction with team members
to be able to finalise experiments under team collaboration.

**Desired experiences:**

-   excellent at mammalian cells / primary cells / stem cells culturing
-   experienced with primary cells isolation (an advantage)
-   experienced in molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, or
    similar
-   university degree in life sciences, medicine, veterinary medicine,
    or similar
-   willingness to learn
-   independent in the laboratory environment
-   fluent in English

**Responsibilities:**

-   establishing mammalian primary cell lines from isolation to
    differentiation
-   present the data in front of the research team and collaborators,
    with recommendations, ideas, and advice
-   working with different biological sources of primary cells

**What you get from us**ü•Ç\
Joining a startup no longer means lousy conditions for employees. Apart
from basic standards such as **5 weeks\' holidays¬†**and **flexible
working hours**, at Mewery, you will have a chance to actually **be part
of a really important shift in human history**, at least the history of
food.‚Ä®

Imagine working in an environment full of **young and vision-driven
individuals** working at **newly equipped 120 m2 premises**, with **team
events** now and then, and an opportunity to build a company from the
early stages. Oh, and there will be **ESOP options for the key
employees**. **So let's Meat UP!**ü§ôüèª
