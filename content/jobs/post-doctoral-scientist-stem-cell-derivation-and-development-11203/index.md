Roslin Technologies is an ambitious, cutting‐edge biotech company
focused on food and agriculture. Our mission is to advance disruptive
biotechnologies to improve how we produce proteins. Alternative proteins
are key for a more sustainable food system. We envision a world where we
can produce animal proteins without harming our health, the planet, or
animals and ensure everyone has access to affordable, nutritious
proteins.

Our main focus is on developing animal cell technologies for the
emerging cultivated meat sector. We develop stem cell lines using
ground-breaking technologies, including induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC). We provide these cell lines to cultivated meat producers
globally who will use these cell lines to develop and produce cultivated
meat. Our approach is unique to this sector both in terms of technology
and business model. Our animal cell lines are playing a key role in
bringing the reality of cultivated meat closer.

Our brilliant team of experts are passionate, curious, inventive and at
the forefront of the ground-breaking work being accomplished in this
rapidly growing, cultivated meat sector.

**About the role**

This role is an exciting career opportunity for a stem cell focussed
post-Doctoral scientist. Our Team is deriving high quality animal stem
cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).

We are currently expanding our team as we expand and scale up our cell
line platform. As part of this, we are looking for a post-Doctoral
scientist who can derive, characterise, and differentiate induced
pluripotent and/or embryonic stem cells (ESC) to support our growing
cell line platform.

You will be involved in the application of cutting-edge approaches to
generate, develop, characterise and stem cell lines from a range of
species.

This will require extensive tissue culture, cell biology and molecular
biology experience.

**Essential skills**

-   Undergraduate degree (BSc/MSc) and PhD in a appropriate discipline 
-   Experience of deriving iPSC and/or ESC
-   Experience of characterising (i.e., microscopy, qPCR, FACs, ICC,
    karyotyping analyses) and archiving stem cell lines
-   Experience in developing/executing stem cell differentiation
    technologies
-   Proven ability to deliver a research project, including
    design/execution of experiments
-   Proven ability to communicate complex information clearly
-   Proven ability to work independently and as a team
-   Strong analytical capabilities
-   Excellent organisational, communication and presentation skills 
-   Excellent computer skills in the use of Office software

**Desirable skills**

-   Industry experience of working to GMP and relevant ISO standards
-   Practical experience of, and/or a strong interest in, working in the
    field of cultivated meat, focusing on cell line development

**Roslin Technologies offers**

-   Competitive and attractive salary and company pension plan 
-   A passionate work environment focused on a fast-growing field, using
    ground-breaking stem cell technologies 
-   Strong emphasis on team performance and personal development 
-   Regular company events to foster our culture


**How to apply**


This role is for a permanent full-time contract. We will offer a
competitive and attractive compensation package.
