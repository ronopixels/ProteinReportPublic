EVERY™, based in South San Francisco, is a leading VC-backed food tech
ingredient company using precision fermentation to create animal
proteins without the animal for the global food and beverage industry.
Originally founded as Clara Foods in 2014, EVERY™ rebranded in 2021 to
better convey its vision to bring animal-free proteins to everyone,
everywhere. EVERY™ is a team of passionate change makers who are
reimagining the factory farm model with a kinder, more sustainable
alternative. Leveraging precision fermentation to produce
hyper-functional and one-to-one replacement proteins from
microorganisms, EVERY™ is on a mission to decouple the world's proteins
from the animals that make them.
