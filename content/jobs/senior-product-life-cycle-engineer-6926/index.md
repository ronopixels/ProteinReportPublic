Oatly was founded back in the 1990s and is based on Swedish research
from Lund University. The company's patented enzyme technology copies
nature's own process and turns fiber-rich oats into nutritional liquid
food that is perfectly designed for humans. Today, the Swedish company
remains independent and dedicated to upgrading the lives of individuals
and the general wellbeing of the planet through a lineup of original oat
products.

THE OATLY WAY

Oatly is a company built on the idea of change. Our mission is to help
people upgrade their everyday lives and the health of the planet by
making great-tasting oat-based food products accessible to a wider
audience in a world-class manner. It\'s why we come to work every day.
And because health and sustainability are so close to our heart, we are
more than just another food company -- we are a lifestyle company. Our
growth is fast - and accelerating. More and more people choose to switch
to a plant-based diet for the sake of their health and the planet. With
headquarters in Malmö and production in Sweden, Netherlands and the US,
our products are available in almost 30 countries across Europe, North
America and Asia. [https://www.oatly.com](https://www.oatly.com/)

THE ROLE

This is a chance to have a direct impact on the product life cycle
management of one of the world's most innovative and sustainable
companies! You will be part of a humble but result-hungry culture and
speedy growth will make this an interesting and rewarding journey. In
this role, you will work in the Product Life Cycle (PLC) team, which is
part of the global innovation organization, and you will collaborate
closely with Quality, Sourcing and Production, as well as with your
Innovation colleagues in the  New Product Development team and
Technology Development team. You will report to the PLC manager and be
based at Oatly in Landskrona. You will be part of a global growth
journey in a company with creative thinking and innovative products. At
Oatly you will have the opportunity to lead product improvements and
product maintenance projects with two of their most important values in
mind, sustainability and health. You will have high expectations to
quickly get in the role and take ownership based on your previous
experience.   But you will not be alone, our awesome team is there to
get you started.

WHAT YOU WILL DO

Lead and participate in product improvement and product maintenance
projects such as:

-   Production process upgrades
-   Capacity increase projects such as co-packer implementations and
    start-up of new Oatly-owned factories
-   Introducing new ingredients and other minor recipe changes 
-   Implementing new packaging solutions and new packaging sizes

You will plan, execute and follow up product performance from lab and
pilot scale to full scale factory trials and factory start-ups. You will
be working in Landskrona as well as at copackers and Oatly factories
internationally. You will thus travel regularly, 30-50 days per year. 

WHO YOU ARE  

You are a very knowledgeable food and/or process engineer with relevant
experience in food processing. You find it inspiring to work with people
and you naturally take initiatives, solve problems and strive to deliver
results. You prefer to work in a structured way but enjoy working on
many kinds of projects. We believe you are a self-motivated person with
the ability to plan and execute efficiently and with high quality. To be
successful you need to be communicative and responsive with a distinct
and transparent communication style. We believe that you will enjoy
contributing to the growth of Oatly with your experience and knowledge.

We hope to see that you check the following boxes:

-   Master of science degree within food science, food technology,
    biotechnology or chemical engineering.
-   At least 5 years of product and process development experience from
    food industry.
-   Deep knowledge within food chemistry and food processing
    technology. Plant-based dairy and/or dairy technology knowledge is a
    great advantage. 
-   Experience from working in complex projects with many stakeholders,
    all the way from idea to final product.
-   Good networking and stakeholder management skills.

We see that you have excellent English skills, verbally and written. It
is a great advantage if you also know Swedish.
