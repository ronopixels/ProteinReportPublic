About The EVERY Company™

The EVERY Company™ is a Bay Area venture capital-backed company working
towards a disruptive advance in food technology by producing animal
proteins without the animal using fermentation. We join a new generation
of entrepreneurs, activists and scientists who recognize that the
decades-old factory farm model cannot sustain the dietary needs of 7
billion people and counting - and that technology may hold a solution.As
much as the growing market demands for animal protein production exert
pressure on food producers to improve their efficiencies and outputs,
there is also growing public distaste for the environmental, animal
welfare, and health compromises of industrial-scale animal agriculture.

The EVERY Company™ aims to subvert this moral and economic deadlock by
taking the animal out of the equation. We're bringing products to the
table that are produced completely animal-free, use less land and water
inputs, while matching the taste, nutritional value, and unique culinary
properties of animal proteins

The EVERY Company DBA Clara Foods is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All
qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without
regard to race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including
pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a
protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other
applicable legally protected characteristics.
