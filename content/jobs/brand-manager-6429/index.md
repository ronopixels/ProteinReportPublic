Bond Pet Foods, one of the hottest startups in biotech and pet care, is
looking to round out its core team with a Brand Manager. This is a rare
opportunity for the right person to help steer a business that is
radically changing the pet food industry by disrupting the outdated,
unsustainable model of conventional agriculture.

This person will have a seriously impressive skill set that includes
things like - being comfortable with big picture vision-setting while
also managing all components of the marketing mix. Being a
self-sufficient leader and problem-solver who can think ahead to "see
around corners" and resolve issues gracefully. An ambitious marketer who
understands how modern brands behave today. Someone who can humbly jump
in and help wherever needed, because this is a startup after all. And,
more tactically, someone with strong project management, social media
and digital chops to shape Bond's brand voice and presence. Startup
and/or pet industry experience a plus.

Functional stuff aside, we're also looking for this person to add their
own unique vibe, personality and dog(!) to our entrepreneurial culture.

### RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE:

-   Manage all aspects of Bond's marketing strategy and development

-   Oversee the creation of various brand assets including packaging,
    website, trade show, collateral and more- from supplier management
    to design and production

-   Collaborate with the Bond team and external agency partners on our
    digital strategy, content, metrics and measurement

-   Help manage vendors and timelines related to various other product
    and operational work streams

-   Assist with investor presentations, updates and reports

### QUALIFICATIONS:

-   4+ years of experience in brand management, account management (at
    an advertising agency) or other relevant experience

-   Passion for animals (pet parents preferred), with a strong desire to
    make a real impact

-   Curiosity to learn about the biotech / food tech space with a hunger
    to get smart about the science behind Bond

-   Highly organized and self-motivated, with the ability to juggle
    multiple priorities autonomously under minimal supervision

-   Entrepreneurial spirit with a willingness to roll up your sleeves to
    meet tight deadlines and drive results

-   Excellent interpersonal and presentation skills -- a "people person"
    who can quickly forge relationships with partners, suppliers,
    vendors and team members

-   Financial acuity

-   Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment

-   Able to maintain highly confidential and proprietary information and
    material

### COMPENSATION:

-   Commensurate with experience

-   Flexible work and vacation hours

-   Dog-friendly office in central Boulder, CO

### ABOUT BOND:

Bond Pet Foods, Inc. is a Boulder, Colorado-based pet food company using
biotechnology to create food that's nutritionally comparable to
conventional meat but without all the bad stuff - so people, pets, farm
animals and the planet all win. Using some of the same processes that
are employed in craft brewing, Bond produces high-quality animal
proteins through fermentation, harvests them to better meet the
nutritional requirements of companion animals, and uses the ingredients
as the foundation of its complete recipes.

alternative protein space including Lever VC, KBW Ventures and
Agronomics, and the company was named a 2019 [Purina Petcare Innovation
