[**ABOUT AIR PROTEIN**]{.underline}

Imagine a meat company unlike anything that has come before! Air
Protein™ is on a mission to impact climate change by revolutionizing how
we make meat. Founded in 2019, we make protein from elements of the air.

Air Protein is a modern food company, crafting the world's first
air-based meats to feed us more sustainably, help renew the planet's
resources and eliminate compromise between nutrition, taste and climate
impact. Using novel technology inspired by NASA, we convert elements
found in the air around us into protein using probiotic cultures, then
turn those proteins into any meat imaginable. It's where cutting-edge
science meets bold ambition to reinvent the way we eat.

Join our team of passionate scientists, engineers, and business leaders
working to transform the future of food with solutions we never thought
possible, creating meat that is nutritious, delicious and more
sustainable. Air Protein uses less land, less water and is significantly
faster to make than any other meat available.

In addition to the chance to work with cutting edge technology to help
combat climate change and working toward addressing the impending food
crisis, Air Protein employees also enjoy competitive benefits and total
compensation plans and a collaborative company culture. If you join us
on this relentless pursuit for more, changing the world will soon feel
as natural as taking a breath.

Air Protein is funded by ADM, a world leader in fermentation technology,
GV (formerly Google Ventures), and Barclays, one of the world's leading
financial institutions.
