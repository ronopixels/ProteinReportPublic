About Clara Foods™

Clara Foods™ is a Bay Area venture capital-backed company working
towards a disruptive advance in food technology by producing animal
proteins without the animal using fermentation. We join a new generation
of entrepreneurs, activists, and scientists who recognize that the
decades-old factory farm model cannot sustain the dietary needs of 7
billion people and counting - and that technology may hold a solution.

As much as the growing market demands for animal protein production
exert pressure on food producers to improve their efficiencies and
outputs, there is also growing public distaste for the environmental,
animal welfare, and health compromises of industrial-scale animal
agriculture.

Clara Foods™ aims to subvert this moral and economic deadlock by taking
the animal out of the equation. We're bringing products to the table
that are produced completely animal-free, use less land and water
inputs, while matching the taste, nutritional value, and unique culinary
properties of animal proteins.

Clara Foods is an Equal Opportunity Employer.  All qualified applicants
will receive consideration for employment without regard to race,
religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy,
childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status
as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally
protected characteristics.
