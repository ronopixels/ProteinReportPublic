Vow is a food company \-- a very different one. We're creating real meat
products from animal cells, instead of the animal itself. We're bringing
together cutting edge innovations in science, technology, culinary and
design to make sustainable food that's both irresistible and accessible
for billions of people worldwide.

The work that we are doing is a critical step on the path to creating a
future where humans can exist in sustainable harmony with our planet,
something we can proudly hand over to our children and grandchildren.
We're not only making food that is great for humans and great for the
earth, but also creating food that is the most delicious, desirable
choice of any food available. This is a mission we believe in deeply.

In our short history since founding in April 2019, we've grown to be a
team of 13 and gained [a lot of
attention](https://www.vowfood.com/press) for our world-first: the first
kangaroo meat cultured in a lab (Wall Street Journal, The Australian and
Channel 9). We've now grown 7 species and counting, with an even more
ambitious plan through 2021 and beyond. We're backed by Australia's most
prolific VC firm [Blackbird Ventures](https://blackbird.vc/portfolio/),
alongside a long list of prominent investors and partners.

As a **Software Engineer - Backend*** *at Vow, you\'ll enable and
dramatically accelerate this future through software and data. You'll
become part of a major industrial revolution happening around the world
today \-- the synthetic biology revolution. In the words of Andreesen
Horowitz, *"Bio today is where information technology was 50 years ago:
on the precipice of touching all of our lives. Just like software---and
because of it---biology will one day become part of every
industry." *[\[1\]](https://a16z.com/2019/10/28/biology-eating-world-a16z-manifesto/#:~:text=Bio%20today%20is%20where%20information,become%20part%20of%20every%20industry.&text=We%20are%20living%20in%20the,biology%20is%20eating%20the%20world.)* *You'll
write software to automate data capture and analysis, program scientific
robots to turn difficult physical tasks in the lab into rapid, fully
reproducible systems, and enable every team member at Vow to do
massively leveraged, creative work everyday.

One day, you'll be building an automated image and stats processing
pipeline to pull data from an array of sensors and devices, analyse cell
culture outcomes, and pipe these into our PostgreSQL & Metabase data
platform ready for visualisation and decisioning. The next, you'll be
programming liquid handling robots and Raspberry Pi's to run cell
culture experiments at 80x the pace of humans working alone. Every
single day, you\'ll be working in a fast-paced environment on the nexus
of software and hardware automation, data science and biology, putting
real food in the hands of people worldwide and making an unambiguously
positive impact on the world. 

You will work directly with our [Head of
Engineering](https://medium.com/vow-food/from-fintech-to-food-sustainability-why-i-joined-vow-29857c875556) and
cross-functionally across our rapidly growing team. You'll be given
ownership and autonomy, empowered to bring the very best ideas to life,
and be positively stretched to your limits everyday. You'll bring your
pragmatism, strong communication skills, desire to make a real world
impact, and sincere empathy for users to your engineering work at Vow.

The position is based in North Parramatta, Sydney, Australia.

### What you\'ll do:

-   Architect, build, and scale backend software as part of a
    biotechnology stack that spans everything
    from [biology](https://ebrc.org/what-is-synbio/) to [hardware](https://opentrons.com/) to
    backend software to frontend apps.
-   Work in a modern backend stack built on TypeScript, Python,
    PostgreSQL, and AWS.
-   Manage and run the entire software development cycle, including
    customer interviews, problem definition, architecture, prototyping,
    testing, training, documentation, and driving key metrics. As you
    gain experience and earn the trust of team members and stakeholders
    alike, you'll be entrusted to define the product and technology
    roadmap in your areas of expertise.
-   Enthusiastically tackle *any* part of the stack as needed for the
    successful shipping of an engineering project, including hardware,
    firmware, data engineering, and frontend, even if it means learning
    a new skill or being out of your comfort zone.
-   Review code and other work materials of your fellow engineers.
-   Meaningfully contribute improvements to our culture and
    organisational processes.
-   Learn about biology, hardware, design and culinary from our
    multidisciplinary team and leverage these balanced perspectives in
    your work.

### **In return, we will support you with:**

-   We'll work tirelessly to provide you a productive, safe, supportive
    and collaborative work environment.
-   Active transparency to let you actively contribute to every facet of
    the business.
-   Access to gym facilities.
-   Constant opportunity for growth, weekly 1:1s, and mentorship from an
    experienced and dedicated leadership team.
-   No legacy overheads \-- the freedom to define the best approach to
    solving problems, both technically and organisationally.
-   Massive room to grow in an exciting, emerging industry.
-   High-stakes work that matters deeply to the company and the world. A
    mission for you to sink your skills and passion into.

### **About you:**

-   You have at least 5 years software engineering experience shipping
    code in production tech stacks, including in mission-critical and
    large scale systems.
-   You have at least 2 years production experience in backend systems
    specifically, as opposed to exclusively in web or mobile frontends.
-   Formal degree qualifications are *not* required, but if you are
    self-taught, then you have evidence of commensurate industry
    experience and demonstrated desire to master your craft.
-   You're kind, curious, take pride in your work, and enjoy learning
    new things.
-   You're product and user obsessed. You constantly think about the
    perspectives of end-users and your impact on the mission even when
    it's not asked of you. Your users feel heard when they provide
    feedback, or better yet, when you actively seek it out.
-   You're able to identify and make pragmatic tradeoffs that
    incorporate cost/benefit into every key decision, rather than aiming
    for perfect or chasing rabbit holes.
-   You effectively communicate challenges, goals, technical concepts
    and project outcomes in clear language suitable for your audience.
-   You\'re mission aligned \-- you want to apply your skills to build a
    better food system and a brighter future. For some of us this is
    about animal welfare, for others it's saving the environment or
    caring deeply about developing incredibly delicious foods - all
    different perspectives on the same mission.

### **Ideally you\'ll also have:**

-   Previous hardware and electronics experience, in a personal or
    professional setting
-   Previous lab experience, ideally in the field of biology
-   Previous relevant experience in automation & robotics
-   A love of food, cooking or experience in a culinary setting
-   A strong command of any of: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python or SQL
-   Experience in Linux server environments
-   Experience in AWS cloud environments

Ultimately this role will be shaped around the right candidate. If you
love the mission and want to work on some of the most exciting and
impactful problems on the planet today, we want to speak to you.

**Vow's mission is to make food products for everyone, and we mean
everyone. To do that well we need a workforce that's representative of
the people we serve. We celebrate multiple approaches and points of
view, we are inclusive and we believe diversity drives innovation - so
we're building a culture to match. Uniqueness is powerful - be yourself
and come as you are.**
