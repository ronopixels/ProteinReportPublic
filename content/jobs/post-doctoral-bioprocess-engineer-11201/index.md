**BACKGROUND:**

[Roslin Technologies](https://roslintech.com/) is an ambitious,
cutting‐edge biotech company focused on food and agriculture. Our
mission is to advance disruptive biotechnologies to improve how we
produce proteins. Alternative proteins are key for a more sustainable
food system. We envision a world where we can produce animal proteins
without harming our health, the planet, or animals and ensure everyone
has access to affordable, nutritious proteins.

Our main focus is on developing animal cell technologies for the
emerging cultivated meat sector. We develop stem cell lines using
ground-breaking technologies, including induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC). We provide these cell lines to cultivated meat producers
globally who will use these cell lines to develop and produce cultivated
meat. Our approach is unique to this sector both in terms of technology
and business model. Our animal cell lines are playing a key role in
bringing the reality of cultivated meat closer.

Our brilliant team of experts are passionate, curious, inventive and at
the forefront of the ground-breaking work being accomplished in this
rapidly growing, cultivated meat sector.

**About The Role**

The Post-Doc Bioprocess Engineer role is an exciting career opportunity
for a Post-Doctoral Scientist with extensive experience of mammalian
cell culture in bioreactors.

Our Team has derived high quality animal stem cells, including induced
pluripotent stem cells. The next step is to show that these cells are
uniquely qualified to scale up to high densities in large bioreactors.
The role will involve you working across our innovation and commercially
facing teams developing and implementing solutions for effective
bioprocessing of our various cell lines.

**Essential Skills:**

-   Undergraduate degree (BSc/MSc) and PhD in a closely related
    discipline (Bioprocessing, Biotechnology, or Bioengineering)
-   Experience in mammalian cell culture systems with experience of
    operating and optimising bioreactors
-   Proven ability to develop and test protocols
-   Proven ability to identify analytical tools most suitable to the
    research
-   Proven ability to deliver a research project, including the design
    and execution of experiments
-   Strong analytical capabilities
-   Excellent communication and presentation skills
-   Excellent computer skills in the use of Office software

**Desirable Skills:**

-   Industry experience of working to GMP and relevant ISO standards
-   Practical experience of working in the area of cultivated meat,
    ideally focusing on scale up and cell density optimisation
-   Experience in cell culture media design and component analysis
-   Experience in project delivery/report writing and/or commercial R&D
    projects

**Roslin Technologies offers**

-   Competitive and attractive salary and generous company pension plan
-   A passionate work environment focused on a fast-growing field, using
    ground-breaking stem cell technologies
-   Strong emphasis on team performance, scientific rigour, and personal
    development
-   Regular company events to foster our culture


**How to apply**


This role is for a permanent full-time contract. We will offer a
competitive and attractive compensation package.
