**About Roslin Technologies** 

Roslin Technologies is an ambitious, cutting‐edge biotech company
focused on food and agriculture. Our mission is to advance disruptive
biotechnologies to improve how we produce proteins. We envision a world
where everyone has access to affordable, nutritious and responsibly
produced protein. Alternative proteins are key to addressing the need
for more food. 

We focus on providing superior biological materials to alternative
protein supply chains. Today, our core competency (\>80% of our
business) is to provide self-replicating cell lines to cultivated meat
producers globally. Cultivated meat is meat grown directly from stem
cells without the need to raise animals. Roslin Tech has the most
advanced cell lines, is the only independent provider globally and we
ship cells to customers in the UK, EU, North America, and Asia. We are
rapidly growing and work very closely with our customers. In addition to
our cell line platform, we are developing and commercialising a breeding
programme for black soldier fly to support the emerging insect protein
sector which is the prime example of circular and sustainable
agriculture. At Roslin Tech we benefit from a privileged relationship
with Roslin Institute, the creator of Dolly the Sheep, and many other
