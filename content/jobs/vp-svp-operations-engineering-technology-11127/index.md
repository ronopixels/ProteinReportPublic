As an innovative food company, we are crafting the world's first
air-based, non-animal meats to eliminate compromise between nutrition,
taste, and climate impact. Using novel technology inspired by NASA, we
convert elements found in the air into protein. Air Protein's process is
carbon-negative by design, using less land and water than animal meat
production, and is powered by renewable energy. It's where cutting-edge
science meets bold ambition to reinvent the way we eat.
