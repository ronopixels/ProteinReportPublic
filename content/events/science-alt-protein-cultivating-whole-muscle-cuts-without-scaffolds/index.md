description: "Can we cultivate whole muscle cuts with full complement of cell types in a scaffold-free manner? Join Dr. Ravi Selvaganapathy as he discusses biofabrication and assembly techniques that are scalable, can incorporate both muscle and fat cells, display both fiber formation and fat production and can generate their own extracellular matrices for production of large and thick whole meat cuts."

Can we cultivate whole muscle cuts with full complement of cell types in
a scaffold-free manner? Join Dr. Ravi Selvaganapathy as he discusses
biofabrication and assembly techniques that are scalable, can
incorporate both muscle and fat cells, display both fiber formation and
fat production and can generate their own extracellular matrices for
production of large and thick whole meat cuts.

Meet the speaker: Dr. P. Ravi Selvaganapathy is a professor in
mechanical engineering and the Canada research chair in biomicrofluidics
at McMaster University in Canada. His research interests are in the
development of microfluidic devices for drug discovery, drug delivery,
diagnostics, artificial organs and tissue engineering. He has over 120
journal publications, has written 6 invited book chapters and been
issued 8 US patents related to MEMS/microfluidic devices. He also
received the Early Researchers Award from the ministry of research and
innovation in 2010 and has been named a Rising Star in Global Health by
Grand Challenges Canada in 2012. In the recent years, he has developed
several biofabrication methods for cultivated meat production.
