description: "How close are we to the scalable production of cultivated meat? We know stem cells are a suitable cell source for developing cultivated meat because they have the ability to differentiate into all requisite cell types. In order to utilize stem cells at-scale, the first step in the production process we need to optimize is the expansion of stem cells prior to their differentiation. Join GFI grantee Dr. Petra Hanga from Aston University to learn about her recent research advancements in developing bioprocess at the litre scale for the expansion of bovine adipose-derived stem cells."

How close are we to the scalable production of cultivated meat? We know
stem cells are a suitable cell source for developing cultivated meat
because they have the ability to differentiate into all requisite cell
types. In order to utilize stem cells at-scale, the first step in the
production process we need to optimize is the expansion of stem cells
prior to their differentiation. Join GFI grantee Dr. Petra Hanga from
Aston University to learn about her recent research advancements in
developing bioprocess at the litre scale for the expansion of bovine
adipose-derived stem cells. Additionally, Dr. Hanga will discuss clever
strategies for the differentiation of these cells to fat and muscle and
the adaptability of these methods to a scalable process.

Meet the speaker: Dr. Mariana Petronela (Petra) Hanga is a Lecturer in
Biological Engineering at Aston University and a GFI grantee. As a
biochemical engineer by training, Dr. Hanga's research interests lie at
the intersection of engineering and the life sciences. Her research
addresses two distinct grand challenges. The first is healthcare, by
developing future therapies that will minimize the economic and social
burden of an aging population; the second is food and nutrition for
health, by advancing cultivated meat technologies that will enable a
radical shift away from livestock products. Dr. Hanga's
multidisciplinary strengths and expertise include an understanding of
the whole cell culture bioprocess from inoculation to harvest, including
engineering characterization of bioreactors and biological
characterization of cells. She holds degrees in biochemical engineering
and regenerative medicine.
