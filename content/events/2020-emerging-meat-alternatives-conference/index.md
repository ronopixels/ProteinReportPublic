description: "Emerging Meat Alternatives Conference (EMAC) is one of few scientific conferences focused on technical aspects of creating plant-based and cultured meats. Emerging meat alternatives are a prime example where biochemical and high-tech chemical engineering problems need to be solved in a multidisciplinary environment with biologists, chemical engineers and bioprocess engineers. The conference will focus on the technologies (and challenges) shared by plant-based and cultured meat alternatives to achieve the goal of creating protein-rich food that can replace conventional meat. "

Emerging Meat Alternatives Conference (EMAC) is one of few scientific
conferences focused on technical aspects of creating plant-based and
cultured meats. Emerging meat alternatives are a prime example where
biochemical and high-tech chemical engineering problems need to be
solved in a multidisciplinary environment with biologists, chemical
engineers and bioprocess engineers. The conference will focus on the
technologies (and challenges) shared by plant-based and cultured meat
alternatives to achieve the goal of creating protein-rich food that can
replace conventional meat.
