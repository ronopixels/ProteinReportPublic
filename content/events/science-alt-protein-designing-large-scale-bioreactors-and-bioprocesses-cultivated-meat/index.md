description: "How can bioreactors and bioprocesses be optimally designed for cultivated meat production? Realizing the potential of cultivated meat and seafood requires adapting current technologies and innovating new bioprocess design. The scales needed to achieve significant levels of food production are far greater than for other tissue-engineered products. Plus, unlike many biomedical applications of tissue engineering bioprocessing which produce high-value products, cultivated meat needs to compete on cost with much more affordable products. Dr."

How can bioreactors and bioprocesses be optimally designed for
cultivated meat production? Realizing the potential of cultivated meat
and seafood requires adapting current technologies and innovating new
bioprocess design. The scales needed to achieve significant levels of
food production are far greater than for other tissue-engineered
products. Plus, unlike many biomedical applications of tissue
engineering bioprocessing which produce high-value products, cultivated
meat needs to compete on cost with much more affordable products. Dr.
Ellis will discuss her team's approach to bioreactor and bioprocess
design for the affordable large-scale production of cultivated meat.
