With almost 10 billion people to feed by 2050, we must evolve the way we
produce and consume food. NIZO and Elsevier are committed to supporting
research for better food and health, tackling the challenge of
developing plant-based ingredients and foods to feed the world in a more
sustainable way. The conference will focus on plant-based proteins
across different biological origins, bringing together researchers in
this field to share and learn with peers from around the globe.

The focus of this scientific conference will be on the following aspects
of plant protein functionality:

-   Plant protein ingredient manufacture
-   Process-product interactions affecting plant protein functionality
-   Fermentation to improve the quality of plant protein ingredients and
    products.
-   Protein structure, stability and interactions within food products
-   Influence of plant protein ingredients in food product structure and
    stability
-   Nutrition and digestion of plant proteins
-   Sustainability along the chain of plant protein ingredients and
    application in foods
