The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the [materiality of working
conditions](https://www.fairr.org/index/index-in-action/) in the
meat-producing sector, including the urgent need to improve labour
standards and corporate practices among animal protein producers to help
mitigate labour risk. This is particularly relevant in the face of
broader industry trends that pose serious human capital challenges, such
as the transition to a green economy.

The FAIRR Initiative and [PIRC](http://www.pirc.co.uk/), therefore,
invite you to a webinar where we will explore the link between
environmental and labour issues in the industrial meat sector. We will
also look at how labour risk can be more effectively addressed by
companies and their investors via worker-centric solutions.
