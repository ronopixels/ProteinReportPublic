description: "The rise of alternative meats—either plant-based or lab-grown— could bring huge benefits for the environment, public health, animal welfare, and potentially even rural workers and the national economy. Currently, progress in this field is slow—alternative meats make up less than 1% of the total meat market share. Accelerating innovation will require government leadership, public policy, and investment."

The rise of alternative meats---either plant-based or lab-grown--- could
bring huge benefits for the environment, public health, animal welfare,
and potentially even rural workers and the national economy. Currently,
progress in this field is slow---alternative meats make up less than 1%
of the total meat market share. Accelerating innovation will require
government leadership, public policy, and investment.

Should the government fund alternative meats? What policies would best
support innovation? Join the Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes
and Issues in Science and Technology for a panel discussion with ALEX
SMITH (Breakthrough Institute), CHRISTY SPACKMAN (Arizona State
University), and JOHNNY REAM (Stray Dog Capital) and moderated by Los
Angeles Times science journalist AMINA KHAN.
