The 2nd Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Protein Innovation Summit will
be taking place January 18-20 in San Francisco. It will host
decision-makers from biotech, food tech, multinationals, independent
food brands and more for those looking to up-scale and commercialize
fermentation-enabled alternative proteins.

This is the only industry-led forum dedicated to scaling-up production
platforms to commercialize clean-label, animal-free and regulatory
approved alternative meat, diary, eggs and functional protein
ingredients.

Back for its second year, this forum will continue to unite the
alternative protein community and ensure sharing of successes and
strategy continues.
