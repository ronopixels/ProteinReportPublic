description: "In the first half of the year, U.S. alternative meat, egg, and dairy companies raised 14% more—more than $850 million—than they had raised in the entirety of 2019, which was also a record-breaking year, according to the Good Food Institute, an organization that tracks the industry. “Cultivated” or “cell-based” meat companies, growing food from animal cells, raised 417% more than in all of 2019. In part, it’s a continuation of a long-term trend. If you are thinking about starting your own alternative protein company then this session is a must-attend!"

In the first half of the year, U.S. alternative meat, egg, and dairy
companies raised 14% more---more than \$850 million---than they had
raised in the entirety of 2019, which was also a record-breaking year,
according to the Good Food Institute, an organization that tracks the
industry. "Cultivated" or "cell-based" meat companies, growing food from
animal cells, raised 417% more than in all of 2019. In part, it's a
continuation of a long-term trend. If you are thinking about starting
your own alternative protein company then this session is a must-attend!
