Returning for its 4th year, Industrializing Cultivated Meats & Seafood
will host the industry leaders from Food Techs, Investors, Multinational
Consumer Packaged Goods, and Food Brands and Manufacturers, to focus on
preparing for Cultivated Meat & Seafood Commercialization.

With the growing need for sustainable food alternatives from both the
mainstream and animal-free industry, it's now vital to prepare for the
commercialization of cultivated products, through scaling-up to meet
market demands and remaining competitive.

If you are creating a new cultivated meat or seafood product, looking to
scale-up your current process to the industrial level, waiting on
regulatory approval to go to market, or wishing to build new
partnerships to optimize your processes, this is the go-to forum to
attend in person in 2022.
