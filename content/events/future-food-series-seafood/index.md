**ProVeg Incubator and NX-Food present \... the foods of the future!**

Welcome to the third event in our Future Food Series! This time, we are
diving into the topic of seafood alternatives.

On 9 December, we will be chatting to startup founders from Europe and
Asia about which products the plant-based and cultivated seafood sectors
have to offer, how to successfully launch them into a huge market full
of potential and what the future is going to bring.

A recent consumer survey on plant-based foods suggests that seafood
alternatives is one of the key areas for innovation and also what
customers are interested in.\*
