ID Capital, the entity spearheading the development of the Future Food
Asia (FFA) platform, is delighted to announce that Dr Ismahane Elouafi,
Chief Scientist at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) will be the Guest of Honour at the seventh edition of the
FFA Conference, on 17th -- 18th of May 2023.

Since its inception in 2017, FFA has acted as a catalyst for
collaborations accelerating the work of technology entrepreneurs in the
agrifood sector, and a pioneer in the then-nascent agrifoodtech vertical
in Asia-Pacific.

FFA will also be innovating the conference style and for the first time
convene Chief Technology Officers, Chief Sustainability Officers and
Investors for exclusive roundtables to identify and accelerate
innovations and business models that are most critical to Asia-Pacific,
to build a more sustainable and inclusive food future.

This new conference format, along with the well-established FFA Award of
US\$ 100,000, will combine the vision of leaders in the industry and
investors with the energy of start-ups and entrepreneurs. More details
will be communicated on the Award as applications open in January 2023.
