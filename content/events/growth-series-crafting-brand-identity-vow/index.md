Join us for a discussion about branding one of Australia\'s hottest food
tech startups with Vow cofounder Tim Noakesmith.

**About this Event**

[Vow](https://www.vowfood.com/) is defining a new category of food using
cultured meat technology. Almost every mouthful of meat eaten on earth
comes from just four animal species our ancestors could domesticate
several millennia ago. We don't replicate these meats, instead Vow is
building a library of cells from both domesticated and undomesticated
species, we will draw on these to create exotic meats that could never
be farmed as well as blends of cells from different species to create
tastier, more nutritious meats than animals could ever produce. Vow's
team of scientists, engineers and designers are bringing these to market
by collaborating with top chefs to create entirely new types of food
from cells, then scaling the best of these into consumer facing brands.

Join us as we go into the process of developing a brand identity with
Tim Noakesmith.

This presentation is available to attendees of all experience levels.

**About the Speaker**

Tim is a serial entrepreneur and design professional who was recently
recognized in Forbes 30 under 30 list. In 2017 Tim became obsessed with
using his centered design background to solve the world\'s most
important problems, eventually realizing that creating the food systems
that will scale to meet an ever-growing population is one of the most
important challenges we face as a human race, so he co-founded Vow, a
food/biotechnology company focussed on feeding billions of people
sustainably. Before launching Vow Tim was most recently the Global
Human-Centered Design Lead for Cochlear, where he was responsible for
untangling the complex needs of Cochlear Implant recipients, ensuring
their insights were core to the organization\'s strategy, all while
working within tight regulatory medical-tech frameworks. He has held a
number of Senior roles in User Experience Design, Service Design and
Product Strategy spanning across a diverse range of industries and
technologies, including blockchain payments, national communications
infrastructure and some of the world\'s most recognizable FMCG brands.
