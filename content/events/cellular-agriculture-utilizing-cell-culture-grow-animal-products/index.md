With the growing threat of climate change, sustainable development has
become more and more critical to our modern society. Researchers all
over the globe have been working non-stop, trying to find a way to meet
continuous human demands, such as food, while conserving our limited
resources.

For that reason, The Chemical Institute of Canada, Toronto Section
(CICTor) is excited to have Dr. Tejeda-Saldana from New Harvest give us
a talk on Cellular Agriculture on Thursday, March 17th, 2021, from 6:00
to 7:00 PM EDT.

Cellular Agriculture, a technology that allows us to obtain agricultural
products using cell cultures, was considered one of the solutions to
mitigate our impact on finite natural resources in the latest IPCC sixth
assessment report. More than just a novel technology to obtain new
products, it has the potential to transform our food system into a more
just and democratic one. But, to achieve this goal, we will need all
hands on deck, collaboration, and openness. This presentation will
provide a brief overview of the science behind cell-cultured food
products and highlight some benefits and challenges the field faces.

*About Dr. Tejeda-Saldana*

Dr. Tejada-Saldana is a food scientist by training and has spent more
than 10 years working in the industry and academia. During graduate
studies, she became interested in the intersection between science and
policy and was actively involved in science communication initiatives.
The experiences led her to pursue a postdoctoral fellowship at the Ivey
Business School, where she used her scientific background to advance
regulatory cooperation between Canada and the U.S. in the agri-food
sector. She is eager to use her background to help build a thriving
cellular agriculture ecosystem worldwide while learning alongside this
innovative field as it evolves.
