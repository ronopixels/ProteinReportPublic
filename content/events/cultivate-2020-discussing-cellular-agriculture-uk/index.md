Cultivate is an annual event to discuss cellular agriculture from UK
perspectives. Cellular agriculture refers to work to produce
agricultural products - typically animal products - through new methods
that operate at the cellular level as opposed to working with whole
animals. Examples include cultured meat and fermentation-based milk.

The event will feature a combination of talks and panels that will
discuss activities and challenges that have risen over the last year.

Our 2020 event will be online via Zoom and last three hours. This is
different to our previous annual events, which have taken place in
person and been whole day events. We look forward to an engaging
discussion.
