Although algae are widely used in biotechnology and agriculture in
Europe and worldwide, and the term algae appears in multiple legal
documents, the term as such is poorly defined. Algae are very diverse
group of organisms, found almost everywhere on the planet. Based on
common use the term algae includes representatives from prokariotes (the
cyanobacteria) and from several kingdoms of the eukariotes, whereby no
scientific agreement currently exists on the exact taxonomic
classification of those multiple  eukaryote kingdoms.

Every year the European algae scene meets at the** AlgaEurope
conference**. AlgaEurope offers a unique opportunity for an exchange
between academia and industry, established in a networking-based
environment that will explore sector's evolution worldwide as well as
the main European players. Currently, there are several European
projects, from lab scale to demonstration plants and commercial
facilities, aiming to accelerate the commercialization of algal
products.
