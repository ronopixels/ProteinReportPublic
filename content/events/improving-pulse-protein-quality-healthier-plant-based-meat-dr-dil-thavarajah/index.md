description: "How can plant breeding optimize the protein quality and bioavailability of pulses for plant-based meat applications? Globally, the plant-based protein market will increase to a $9.5 billion industry by 2025. The demand for plant-based protein is growing due to increased awareness of ecosystem health, climate change, animal welfare, and antibiotic resistance. To meet this demand, ingredient suppliers are seeking novel clean, pesticide-free plant proteins from organic pulses, cereals, and oil crops."

How can plant breeding optimize the protein quality and bioavailability
of pulses for plant-based meat applications? Globally, the plant-based
protein market will increase to a \$9.5 billion industry by 2025. The
demand for plant-based protein is growing due to increased awareness of
ecosystem health, climate change, animal welfare, and antibiotic
resistance. To meet this demand, ingredient suppliers are seeking novel
clean, pesticide-free plant proteins from organic pulses, cereals, and
oil crops. The development and selection of nutritionally superior
organic pulse crops have the potential to bring significant economic
value and agricultural sustainability benefits to organic growers as
well as health and nutritional value to consumers. Join Dr. Dil
Thavarajah, Associate Professor at Clemson University, as she discusses
her research on the production of organic pulses to improve protein
quality and bioavailability.\
