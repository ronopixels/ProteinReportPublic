**Future Food-Tech's new dedicated Alternative Proteins Summit on June
22-23 will connect global food leaders to map out the future of
protein.**

Focusing on three key pillars: plant-based, cell-based, and microbial
fermentation, it will bring together CPG leaders, entrepreneurs,
investors, ingredient providers, retailers and food service providers to
unpack the possibilities of these technologies and create unified
approaches to scaling the next generation of novel proteins.

From ingredient discovery and product formulation, to regulation,
communication and commercialization, conversations will dive into all
facets of alternative proteins and provide a comprehensive overview of
key players, markets, and solutions.

An intuitive, easy-to-use virtual platform offers 1-1 networking, online
discussion groups, Ask Me Anything sessions and other unique
opportunities to connect with fellow leaders in the sector and create
long term business relationships.
