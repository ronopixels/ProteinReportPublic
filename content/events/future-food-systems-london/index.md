We're giving you the chance to re-imagine the current food system in
this special post-summit think-in on 2 March.

Led by advisor, speaker, and sustainable business commentator Mike
Barry, the think-in will bring together a unique combination of
participants from across the value chain.

Join ambitious and innovative change agents to:

-   be inspired

-   challenge the status quo

-   approach systemic challenges from a fresh perspective

-   unlock creativity and boundary-pushing solutions

-   share opportunities for bold action

Building on insights and innovations shared during the Future Food
Systems global digital summit, the think-in will take a deeper look at
the actions needed to deliver sustainable nutrition at scale, tackle
climate change and create equity in the food system.
