Do we need to recall the numbers? The numbers of how the global meat
industry harms both the planet and the people living on it? The numbers
of the environmental damages caused by eggs and dairy? Probably not.
Instead, we would like to shed light on **how innovation can solve the
carnivore conundrum.**

Humans have been using fermentation to produce bread, cheese or beer for
many thousand years. Since then, we have come to scientifically
understand the processes of **fermentation and their potential for a
more sustainable food system** as well as for our wellbeing.

Today, fat, proteins and dairy are being produced as well as taste
enhancers, colors and packaging -- all by using microorganisms such as
fungi, algae and bacteria, which can be chosen, or engineered, for very
specific purposes. In fact, Fermentation is expected to be a key
component in the shift toward alternative proteins. Fungi are becoming
the new cows. Already, the **investment bonanza has started.** In 2020
alone, fermentation companies raised \$587 million USD. What once
started with barrels of magically bubbling liquids has turned into the
science of precision fermentation.
