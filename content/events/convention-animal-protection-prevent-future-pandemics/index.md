With the COVID-19 death toll approaching three million in March of 2021,
twenty-five heads of state echoed the World Health Organisation's call
for a global pandemic treaty. With the majority of the world\'s focus
since being dedicated to pandemic preparedness and response,
insufficient attention has been paid to our ability to prevent pandemics
in the first place.

Like Ebola, HIV-AIDS, Nipah Virus, SARS, and others, COVID-19 spilt over
from animals to humans, with our high-risk contact with, if not
mistreatment of, animals lying at the heart of each of these zoonotic
disease outbreaks. As such, without a global agreement to regulate our
interaction with animals, a repeat of the current pandemic is simply a
matter of time.

Join this panel of attorneys and academics as they discuss how a newly
proposed treaty, the Convention on Animal Protection for Public Health,
Animal Welfare, and the Environment (CAP), not only holds the promise of
being humanity\'s first and best line of defence against future
pandemics by creating a universal platform for animal protection but
would also recognise that animals, as sentient beings, deserve to have
their well-being accounted for.
