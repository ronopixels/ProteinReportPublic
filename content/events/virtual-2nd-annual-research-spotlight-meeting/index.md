The Plant Protein Innovation Center\'s 2nd Annual Research Spotlight
Meeting will be held virtually this year on Tuesday, November 17th! The
Research Spotlight Meeting showcases research that is actively being
conducted in the plant proteins space, including the five projects
funded by PPIC. The event features presentations from several
researchers, internal and external to the PPIC researcher cohort. The
event also includes an interactive e-poster session with the opportunity
to speak with students and researchers directly and ask questions about
their research. The event will be formatted in breakout sessions, giving
attendees the option to customize their day based on which presentations
and e-poster sessions they would like to attend. There will be a number
of networking breakout sessions built in the day to provide ample
opportunity to connect with potential collaborators, customers,
partners, and fellow plant protein aficionados. \
