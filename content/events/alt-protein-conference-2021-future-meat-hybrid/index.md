The Protein Directory and Cell Agri are proud to present the Alt Protein
Conference 2021: 'The Future of Meat: Hybrid' with a focus on the new
wave of companies transforming the future of meat.

Join us for a 1-day virtual conference to learn how future food
companies are combining the *best of both worlds* and creating hybrid
meats with both cellular agriculture and plant-based alternative
proteins.

With keynotes and panels by global leaders and industry experts on the
topic of developing hybrid meats, this virtual conference brings
together the alternative protein industry working to build the
sustainable future of food.

Learn about the key business opportunities in alternative proteins as
the field transitions towards hybrid products and network with business
and scientific leaders in both the cellular agriculture and plant-based
alternative protein industries.
