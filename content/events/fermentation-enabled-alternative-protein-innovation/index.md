The** 3rd annual* Fermentation-Enabled Alternative Protein Summit*, **as
the only industry-led forum uniting the entire biomass and precision
fermentation ecosystem, will return to San Francisco as an in-person
meeting. Hosting 150+ key decision-makers from biotech and food tech,
multinational consumer packaged goods, independent food brands, and
ingredient suppliers, this 3-days summit will help you scale-up and
successfully commercialize fermentation-enabled alternative with speed
to market. 

We're excited to introduce 35+ expert speakers and 2 dedicated streams
to the 2023 summit to help technical scientists and commercial leaders
across the fermentation protein value chain.

Whether you are currently developing a new fermentation-enabled protein
product offering, securing production capacity to achieve scale-up, or
are looking to launch into the growing consumer alternative protein
space, this is your key meeting to kick off 2023 to turbocharge
next-generation alternative protein sources.
