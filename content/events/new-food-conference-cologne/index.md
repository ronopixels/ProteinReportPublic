**Plant-based meets cellular agriculture: two complementary approaches
towards a more resilient food system**

We are on the cusp of one of the fastest and most consequential
transformations of the food system since humans first started
domesticating plants and animals. Sales of plant-based products are
skyrocketing, while cellular agriculture and precision fermentation hold
the potential to change the way we grow our food forever.
