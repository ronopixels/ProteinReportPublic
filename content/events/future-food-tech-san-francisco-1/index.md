**Strengthening Sustainable & Nutritious Food Systems**

As the world adjusts to the impacts of climate change, conflict, and a
changing economic landscape, securing access to sustainable and
nutritious food is more important than ever.

After returning to in-person events last year with a bang, Future
Food-Tech is back in the epicentre of innovation, San Francisco, on
March 16-17, 2023. The summit has become a global hub, connecting 1600
international food brands, ingredient providers, investors, start-ups
and technology leaders, whilst digging into the crucial issues facing
the food industry today.

Over the two-day summit, food-tech pioneers and visionaries will discuss
innovative approaches to scaling alt-proteins, new formulations for
healthier, nutrient packed foods, and commercial opportunities at the
intersection of food and medicine.

This year, alongside an action-packed main agenda, expect to see even
more ground-breaking innovator action in our new Start-Up Arena, with a
front row seat for cooking demos, food tastings, pitching sessions and
interactive workshops.

Hundreds of new partnerships will emerge from the summit, as deals are
made over delicious plant-based lunches, networking cocktail evenings
and a full program of 1-1 meetings.
