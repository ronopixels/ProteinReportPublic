Since 2018 this food technology innovation conference has attracted
leaders in food production, food and agricultural science and innovators
across the food manufacturing sector.

With a firm focus on practical business outcomes, this conference is
aimed at people in the food production and food supply chains.

ProteinTECH showcases entrepreneurs achieving growth and niche market
outcomes in emerging food technologies.

In 2022, we have an exciting new format. ProteinTECH 2022 is now a
hybrid event, with in-person venues located in Sydney, Auckland and

Meet the trailblazers, innovators and early adopters making their own
path through a rapidly growing new market.
