The Virtual Summit on AgTech is hosted by the Tuck Center for Private
Equity and Venture Capital in collaboration with the Tuck Food &
Agriculture Club. This online conference focuses on current trends and
issues in agriculture and technology.

The Tuck AgTech Summit aims to bring together some of the most important
people and organizations pushing this space forward in order to
accelerate the spread of knowledge, create new connections, and generate
ideas. Now in its second year, the virtual conference will cover a wide
range of cutting-edge topics with an impressive lineup of over 40
speakers from around the globe.

In contrast to other conferences and convenings, the Tuck AgTech Summit
is designed to be accessible from anywhere in the world with a simple,
low-cost registration.  Using the
innovative [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/) platform, attendees
join an interactive online environment.  Registration requires a small
donation (\$5 minimum).  All conference proceeds will be donated to two
non-profit partners---Feeding America and the Young Farmers Coalition.
