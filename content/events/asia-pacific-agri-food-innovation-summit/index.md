**Scaling Sustainable Food Production in Asia**

Now in its fourth year, the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation
Summit will bring together the world's leading agribusinesses, growers,
CPG and ingredient brands, entrepreneurs, investors, retailers and
policymakers to share ideas and collaborate towards greater security and
sustainability in Asia's agri-food system.

From empowering smallholder farmers and building more connected,
resilient supply chains to indoor farming models, holistic nutrition and
health strategies, the summit will identify the most important
opportunities and challenges as the region recovers from the COVID-19
pandemic.

A hybrid event combining both in-person elements in Singapore and a full
virtual experience tailored to an international audience, the summit
will facilitate high-value connections and foster long-lasting business
relationships.

Knowledge exchange is an integral part of the innovation cycle. By
sharing best practice from around the globe and enabling new
partnerships, the summit offers an invaluable platform for developing a
strategic, unified approach to scaling technologies and accelerating
progress towards a greener and more secure food system.

Over a three-day summit, the smart virtual platform offers live-streamed
debates and panel discussions, online roundtables and fireside chats, as
well as 1-1 networking. All content will be available to watch on demand
for a month after the summit.
