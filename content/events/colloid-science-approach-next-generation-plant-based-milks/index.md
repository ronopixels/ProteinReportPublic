description: "More and more people are interested in switching from animal-based to plant-based food products due to health, environmental, and ethical reasons. However, a major barrier to the adoption of plant-based products is that they often do not have the same desirable functional and sensory attributes as their conventional animal-based counterparts. Join Dr. Julian McClements—Distinguished Professor in Food Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst—as he outlines the fundamental science behind the development of next-generation plant-based milks to close the functional and sensory gap."

More and more people are interested in switching from animal-based to
plant-based food products due to health, environmental, and ethical
reasons. However, a major barrier to the adoption of plant-based
products is that they often do not have the same desirable functional
and sensory attributes as their conventional animal-based counterparts.
Join Dr. Julian McClements---Distinguished Professor in Food Science at
the University of Massachusetts Amherst---as he outlines the fundamental
science behind the development of next-generation plant-based milks to
close the functional and sensory gap. Julian will take us through recent
research advancements in utilizing structural design principles in
colloid science to improve the quality and nutritional attributes of
plant-based milks.

Meet the speaker: David Julian McClements is a Distinguished Professor
of Food Science at the University of Massachusetts, an Adjunct Professor
at Zhejiang Gongshang University, and a visiting Professor at the School
of Public Health at Harvard University. He specializes in the areas of
food biopolymers and colloids, with a special emphasis on using
structural design principles to improve the quality, safety, shelf-life
and nutritional attributes of foods McClements received his Ph.D. in
Food Science (1989) at the University of Leeds (United Kingdom) in
ultrasonic spectrometry. He then did Post-Doctoral Research at the
University of Leeds, University of California (Davis) and University
College Cork (Ireland). Prof. McClements has previously received awards
from the American Chemical Society, American Oil Chemists Society,
Society of Chemical Industry (UK), International Union of Food Science
and Technology, Institute of Food Technologists, and University of
Massachusetts in recognition of his scientific achievements.
