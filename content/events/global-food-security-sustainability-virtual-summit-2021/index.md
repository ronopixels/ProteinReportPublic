The Global Food Security & Sustainability Virtual Summit 2021 held on 17
September 2021, would be one of the most important events ever held to
address the critical issues of food security from the local to global
level, and from an interdisciplinary and systemic food systems
perspective. The summit will invite multi-stakeholders from governmental
organisations, private sector businesses and NGOs to address the current
disruptions and possible solutions on the world food supply chain. 
Discussions will also include issues surrounding sustainability issues
and how societies and businesses can design more sustainable solutions
in their entire food chain to minimize impact to the environment and
reduce food waste.
