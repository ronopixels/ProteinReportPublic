Using the seafood industry as a model, this webinar will explore how
brands can leverage collaboration with traditional and non-traditional
partners to pivot their business model to redefine sustainability in
their industry.

The world's oceans represent 70% of the earth's surface, the livelihoods
of more than 40 million people, and the primary source of nutrition for
billions. They play a critical role in the health of our planet as well
as our ability to feed the growing population. The challenges of the
global pandemic have only amplified the need for companies to address
the impact of their actions on people, food systems, labor and the
planet -- and oceans are a huge part of that.

This webinar will describe avenues for ensuring that we have enough
seafood for future generations by expanding the very definition of what
seafood includes. From ocean-inspired alternative seafood and
plant-based options, to cellular development, to regenerative ocean
farming, the experts on this panel discussion will explain how they are
working toward expanding the definition of seafood for the industry at
large and for consumers everywhere.
