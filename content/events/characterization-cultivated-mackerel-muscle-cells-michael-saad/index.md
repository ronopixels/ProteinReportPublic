description: "Generating cell lines for cultivated seafood is relatively understudied, especially when compared to mammalian species. After screening different aquatic organisms, the Kaplan Lab at Tufts University successfully isolated satellite cells from mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Characterization is underway, as proof of satellite cell stemness, myogenic differentiation efficiency, and transdifferentiation into adipocyte-like cells have all been demonstrated. Join Michael Saad, a Ph.D."

Generating cell lines for cultivated seafood is relatively understudied,
especially when compared to mammalian species. After screening different
aquatic organisms, the Kaplan Lab at Tufts University successfully
isolated satellite cells from mackerel (Scomber scombrus).
Characterization is underway, as proof of satellite cell stemness,
myogenic differentiation efficiency, and transdifferentiation into
adipocyte-like cells have all been demonstrated. Join Michael Saad, a
Ph.D. Candidate at Tufts University, as he outlines the benefits and
challenges of cellular aquaculture and delves into the details behind
the characterization of primary mackerel muscle cells.

**Meet the speaker:**\
Michael Saad is a second-year Ph.D. student in the Kaplan Lab at Tufts
University, where his research focuses on cultivated seafood. He
received his B.S. in Bioengineering from Rice University. Prior to
joining the Cellular Agriculture Group at Tufts, Michael was a research
associate at Perfect Day Foods on the Bio-Analytics team, supporting the
R&D team as Perfect Day brought animal-free dairy products to shelves.
