**Moonshot Solutions for a Food System Under Stress**

Our food system is undergoing a revolution. Covid-19 and the threat of
climate change are driving unprecedented demand for more efficient,
nutritious and sustainable solutions.

Future Food-Tech's flagship San Francisco summit, hosted virtually, will
act as a digital bioreactor -- bringing together West Coast innovators,
global food brands, ingredient providers and investors to grow ideas
from concept to reality.

New formats, from interactive mentoring to Ask Me Anything sessions,
will be coupled with fireside chats, panel discussions and a plethora of
1-1 networking opportunities to address the biggest opportunities in the
food-tech sector.

**The summit will focus on:**

-   **Food Security and Resilience:** Futureproofing Our Supply Chain to
    Anticipate, Absorb and Recover from External Shocks
-   **Bench to Production:** Overcoming Scaling Challenges to Bring
    Novel Proteins to Market
-   **The Future of Meat:** Are Cell and Plant-Based Hybrids the Future
    of Meat?
-   **Boosting Immunity:** Functional Foods to Help Us Live Longer --

-   **Personalization and Diet:** Leveraging Consumer Technology to
    Address Nutrient Deficiency and Wellness
-   **Unpacking the Possibilities:** What Materials Hold the Key to a
    Plastic-Free Future?
-   **Human Contact-Less:** How are Retailers and Restaurants Responding
    to the New Normal?
-   **Paths to Exit:** How Has Coronavirus Impacted Investment
    Strategies?
