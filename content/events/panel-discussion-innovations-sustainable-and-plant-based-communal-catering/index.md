The first panel discussion of the PlantEurope network is focusing on
\"Innovations in sustainable and plant-based community catering\". The
promotion of community catering with an increased proportion of
seasonal, regional and ecologically friendly, climate-friendly food can
contribute significantly to the change of our food system. In the
two-hour panel discussion we would like to discuss how plant-based
products can have an impact in this specific category and which actors
from Europe are setting a good example.
