**How to successfully enter and navigate within the fermentation sector
as a food company?**

-   How is fermentation used in the food industry? What does it look
    like in practice?
-   How to extract/utilize the microbial biomass/protein resulting from
    fermentation?
-   What are major and upcoming microorganisms to consider in novel food
    production?
-   What are the pros and cons of these different microorganisms?
-   Which AgriFood side streams could serve as a substrate for
    fermentation processes?
-   How to use the fermentation of side streams to produce microbial
    proteins?
-   What other high-value products will be provided by microbial biomass
    besides protein?
-   How to scale up fermentation technologies?
-   What will the microbial biomass/protein production sector look like
    in the future?

**These are the questions that we will discuss at our upcoming webinar
dedicated to fermentation technologies.Â **
