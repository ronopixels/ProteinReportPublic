VegMed is a unique congress for healthcare professionals that goes
beyond the standard medical conference. While being highly scientific
with its line-up of renowned physicians and academics, it addresses the
current challenges of the healthcare system from a more holistic
perspective, taking into account not only the latest findings in
evidence-based nutrition and health but also highlighting the link
between nutrition, pandemics, and planetary health. Crucially, VegMed's
key goal is to offer practical advice that physicians, dieticians,
nutritional scientists, students, and other healthcare professionals can
use in their daily practices to help their patients improve their diets
and, thereby, their health. Taking place as an online conference in
2021, VegMed Web will be a highly interactive and engaging platform, and
will also enable attendees to expand their international network.
