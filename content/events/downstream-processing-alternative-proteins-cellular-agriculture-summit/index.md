*Advance Protein & Cell Harvest, Purification, End Product
Characterization & Formulation for Commercially Viable Fermentation
Proteins & Cellular Agriculture Products*

The Downstream Processing for Alternative Proteins & Cellular
Agriculture Summit is your dedicated community to help you evaluate
current downstream strategies to reduce cost, improve titer, and
guarantee quality for commercial scalability.

Across 3 hands-on workshops and 2 days of data-driven case studies, the
Downstream Processing for Alternative Proteins & Cellular Agriculture
Summit will share recent advances in downstream processing that have
unlocked next-gen novel foods' commercial viability from the likes of
Impossible Foods, BlueNalu, Remilk, Helaina, and Finless Foods.

Join 60+ CTOs, process engineers, regulatory and quality specialists,
product developers, and analytical chemists at the only dedicated
downstream processing meeting within the fast-evolving world of next gen
novel foods. Return to the office with practical insights to rapidly
scale-up your alternative novel foods' production and bring your product
to customers.
