The FAIRR Initiative and the Jeremy Coller Foundation are hosting the
first international law and policy conference on the future of protein.
As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference aims to
inspire effective, impact-driven policy and innovation to feed the world
while protecting the environment, human health, and animal welfare.

The summit will focus on the role of policymaking on food system
transitions, and policy levers to enable a healthy, sustainable food
system within planetary boundaries. Speakers will represent the worlds
of policymaking, agriculture, responsible investment and the broader
finance sector.
