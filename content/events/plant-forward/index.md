Plant Forward is the first-ever international event showcasing Canada's
plant-based ingredient and food supply and innovation.

We\'re inviting CEOs, CFOs, R&D leaders and investors at the forefront
of the global food industry to:

-   Gain diverse perspectives from leaders on the future of
    plant-forward
-   Learn more about Canada's integrated plant-based ecosystem
-   Meet key players and find opportunities for unique collaborations
-   Understand the natural production, sustainability and geographical
    advantages Canada has to offer

Together, we\'ll have conversations about how the industry is evolving,
what challenges lie ahead and what investors are paying attention to.

The future of food is plant-based. The future of food is Canada.
