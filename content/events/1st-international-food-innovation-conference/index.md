The past decades in food production have seen a move in one direction
only: towards a growing worldwide entanglement along the nutrition value
chain. But this chain is being challenged -- by changing consumer
demands, by new technologies and, lately, by the pandemic.

Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the multiple facets of
sustainability, from ethical standards to responsible manufacturing, and
are demanding more control over the provenance of the products they buy.
At the same time, climate change, shrinking farmland and a growing world
population are putting pressure on traditional methods of food
production and distribution.

When it comes to meeting the challenge of feeding nine billion people
while preserving the natural environment, innovation will be key.
Already, startups and established companies alike are implementing novel
ways to produce, process, distribute and recycle our daily bread.
Plant-based meat has made its way onto supermarket shelves. Thanks to
significant investment, scientists in laboratories around the world are
recreating our nutrition, from dairy to meat. Is cellular agriculture
the future of food?

At the conference on **29 June 2021**, the theme of which is **Farms,
Labs and Beyond: Fixing a Broken Food System**, we will introduce you to
cutting-edge research, revolutionary new business models and smart
thinkers, presenting the latest in food innovation.

**A hybrid event**\
This conference can be booked as a livestream event with
