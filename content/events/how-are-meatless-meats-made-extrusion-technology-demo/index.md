**How are \"meatless\" meats made? Come and learn with food innovation
experts Deutsches Institut für Lebensmitteltechn**

## About this Event

Value-added processing of agricultural products is a great opportunity
for Canadians to create jobs, diversify the economy, and create tasty
products that we can be proud of!

In this 1-hour webinar come and learn how \"meatless\" meats are made
with extrusion technology. There will be a tour of DIL\'s food
innovation lab and an explanation of the different opportunities to use
this technology as well as time for questions.

This is the first in a series featuring how different value-added
products are made including farm and factory tours.

**About the speaker:**

[Volker
Lammers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-lammers-b64415aa/?originalSubdomain=de),
Head of Research Platform Process Engineering
at [DIL](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ppaa-webinar-how-are-meatless-meats-made-extrusion-technology-demo-tickets-106800980608)

DIL is a leading global contract research company based in Germany that
recently opened an office in Calgary.

**About food processing extrusion technology:**

Extruders can be found in many of today's industries, particularly in
polymer, pharmaceutical, and food processing. Their use has expanded
over the last decades due to versatile applications, high throughput,
and low production costs. Typical examples for extruded food products
are pasta, breakfast cereals, snacks, and Texturized Vegetable Protein
(TVP). The integration of different unit operations plus the continuous
operation mode facilitate the development of a wide range of products
with tailored attributes. Depending on ingredients and process
conditions, the raw material undergoes transformations that can lead to
products with very diverse properties.

Besides many other applications, extrusion is highly suitable to convert
protein based raw materials under defined thermal and mechanical
stresses into fibrous products with meat-like structure. The so-called
High Moisture Extrusion (HME) can be considered a key technology for
vegetarian and vegan meat analogues.
