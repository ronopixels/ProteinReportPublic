The Food Biotech Congress is not another alternative protein,
plant-based conference or generic food technology or bulk buy
ingredients event.

Instead, it's a next-gen ingredients forum for senior executives
covering the critical business dynamics and taste, texture and nutrition
challenges from biotech and cell-based approaches across the main food
pillars (Fat, Protein, Sugar and Salt).

Spotlighting companies solely at the disruptive intersection between
food and biotech. Including cultivated food, digital sensory,
fermentation and bio-manufacturing developing functional ingredients to
tackle not only developing cost effective sustainable food products to
satisfy the consumer trend with traditional profiles but also address
the growing consumer need to deliver more healthier options.

Proven track record in building executive level communities across the
biotech, nutrition, health and wellness industries. Enabling food
innovators, CPG/FMCG, ingredient suppliers, plant-based companies,
manufacturers and investors to find the right partner and grow
long-lasting relationships.

We hope you can join us to Connect with a Purpose.
