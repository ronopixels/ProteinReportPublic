The alternative proteins industry is in the midst of rapid development.
In the first couple months of 2020, a whopping \$930 million was
invested in alternative proteins, topping record-setting 2019 totals. In
the short term, as highlighted by BTI's federal policy paper, the
pandemic and economic downturn have shuttered food service outlets,
restricted alternative protein R&D, and induced potential losses in
private sector funding and production slow downs. But it could be argued
that other areas of our food system have seen greater challenges and
outbreaks amid the pandemic. As consumers show more enthusiasm for
alternative meats and companies reach milestones like building the first
pilot production facilities for cell-based meat, how will the pandemic
have impacted the future of alternative meats?

Has the pandemic's negative impact on the sector hampered the industry's
rapid development? What is the likely trajectory of alternative
proteins? Will the public sector play a role? What alternative protein
technologies or trends are the most exciting or promising? What gaps
remain in answering these questions?

In this webinar, we\'ll hear from Purdue University food and agriculture
economist, Jayson Lusk, the Good Food Institute's Director of Corporate
Engagement, Alison Rabschnuk, Breakthrough Institute food and
agriculture analyst, Saloni Shah, and Forbes food and agriculture
writer, Jenny Splitter.
