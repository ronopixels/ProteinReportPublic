Agri-Food Tech Expo Asia provides a leading focused exhibiting platform
for companies in agri-food related industries to launch, showcase and
testbed their solutions. These companies will be part of an essential
growing network of key emerging and established industry players, as
they embark on collaborative initiatives, partnerships, prototype
developments and pilot projects together, towards strengthening the
resilience and sustainability of Asia's food production sectors. The
inaugural edition of the Expo will focus on key themes such as
Aquaculture & Urban Protein Production, Food Safety & Security, Food
Waste Management, and Smart Farming. A unique O2O (online to offline)
hybrid event experience comprising a "living lab" environment, thematic
experiential zones, sandbox and community-based learning and engagement,
and targeted business matching to meet the specific needs of Asia.
